This is precisely the reason why I am requesting with this issue a binding policy decision by PQCA as to the setting of this config -- and to inform everyone subscribing of this permanent policy within the registration email.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to officially make this a policy.  Our default policy is that everything should be as open as possible.  This means that almost everything except budget discussions and security vulnerability disclosures are public.  If we make a policy, then people might assume that some things aren't open, which is not what we want.\r\n\r\n> Without this, PQCA can decide at any time to close out the general public from its discussion(archive)s (or again \"UI bugs\" may happen or --not exactly trust-enhancing-- things like \"the Linux Foundation automation bot or Todd Benzies made some changes\").\r\n\r\nWe can't control all bugs, but we can promise that as LF staff we won't close out the general public from discussion archives.  In general, you can assume that we will strive to make everything as open as reasonably possible.\r\n\r\n> This actually also is one of the reasons why I am not on Discord: As an independent, non-Linux Foundation member I do not want to hand control over information flow to FOSS projects I maintain to a corporate-controlled entity that can [remove access or data at any time](https://discord.com/terms#5):\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, we would have open source software hosting tools that are fully decentralized.  You could imagine a decentralized hosting service that functioned like a blockchain and simultaneously hosted software and tools for software on a number of different clouds and platforms, meaning that no company could censor or remove access to software or communications.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not where we are today.  While you correctly point out that Discord is centrally controlled, so is Github itself (it's a subsidiary of Microsoft).  In theory, Microsoft could take everything on Github down tomorrow.  While this is obviously an extremely low probability event, the probability of such a thing happening for Discord is also probably quite small (although maybe not as small as that of Github).  So, while I sympathize with your principles, I am willing to compromise for the sake of efficiency.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PQCA/governance/issues/comments/1986517929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-08T22:33:34Z","org":{"id":150372837,"login":"PQCA","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/PQCA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150372837?"}}
