[...\r\n\r\n@hartm I said before and keep repeating that LinuxFoundation's [t's and c's for the LFID](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/terms) IMO are not exactly supportive of free speech and openness:\r\n\r\n> Linux Foundation reserves the right to take down anything you post on this site, for these or other reasons. If you don’t agree to these terms, don’t use this website.\r\n\r\nI have no problem agreeing that all reasons explicitly stated (\"these\") warrant removal of content (and myself would surely not post \"such stuff\" nor want to be exposed to it). But what is not acceptable to me is the wording \"other reasons\": With this completely unconditional statement, you guys reserve the right to remove any content you simply don't like. And that is not free speech. Hence, I follow your own advice (\"don’t use this\").\r\n\r\nTechnically, allow me to ask what's stopping you from scouring GH for the information you want to collect separately via LFID? By way of example for myself: \"Employer\", location, GH org affiliation: all accessible -- and I presume not just by screen scraping (?) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c0538f-5837-44f8-8dc1-f077d52a6a0d)\r\n\r\nOr does Microsoft (GH) legally or technically prohibit you from using GH APIs to retrieve this information and address what seems to be a \"long standing pain point\" in @ryjones words?\r\n\r\n> We also obviously respect GDPR so you can request to be \"forgotten\" at any time.\r\n\r\nGood to hear you're following the law :). But that alone makes me wonder: What's LF doing if someone wants to be forgotten? Also delete all the comments of that person? All cross-references to that person (and her comments)? Yuck. Better not collect the information in the first place :-)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PQCA/TAC/issues/comments/2265412477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-08-02T13:30:57Z","org":{"id":150372837,"login":"PQCA","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/PQCA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150372837?"}}
