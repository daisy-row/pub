Thanks for setting it up! A bit disappointing that the tool only makes org&location display decisions based on email addresses, not GH (location/address) info. Of course, if it did, US and corp contributions would be shown as low as they really are -- and LF surely wouldn't want _that_ to happen :-) Hints: UWaterloo is not in the US; neither am I. \r\n\r\nAlso sub-optimal that one can only change the timescales with an LF account, say to dissect the \"before and after LF take-over\" effect -- but that's probably also a thing LF wouldn't really want to make publicly visible via its own tooling. \r\n\r\nThen, @SWilson4: Time to ask for a pay rise looking at these graphs :-) Related, a comment to @hartm: Looking at these charts I now completely understand what you meant by saying people \"game\" this stuff...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PQCA/TAC/issues/comments/2260943563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-31T16:45:56Z","org":{"id":150372837,"login":"PQCA","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/PQCA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150372837?"}}

At the LF, it enables us to rigorously track analytics.  For companies, it enables them to track their contributions relative to other comparable companies, and even do this in a cross-project and cross-foundation way.  Corporate execs also like to say \"we contributed XYZ lines of code to open source\" which they can do with these numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you're reading this, and comfortable providing your employer information and email, sign up for an LF ID and link your email and github!  This also lets us contact maintainers more easily when we need to do so.\r\n\r\n> Also sub-optimal that one can only change the timescales with an LF account, say to dissect the \"before and after LF take-over\" effect -- but that's probably also a thing LF wouldn't really want to make publicly visible via its own tooling.\r\n\r\nWe believe in radical transparency.  While we probably can't get the LFX Insights team to literally draw a line on all of our graphs, this data is available for anyone who cares to look.  Getting an LF account is free and very easy.
