In the nix shell, `checksum` should be available instead of typing the whole path. \r\n\r\nIn the ci action for setting up nix, I switched to use `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action` instead, as `nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action` currently doesn't support installing `nix` on macOS.\r\n\r\nI've also added a summary for workflows, since I'm a bit lazy to jump into ci steps to see what's going on everytime :joy:\r\n\r\n- **refactor nix configuration**\r\n- **use macos-latest(arm64) as ci runner**\r\n- **Add summary for github action**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

In the nix shell, `checksum` should be available instead of typing the whole path. \r\n\r\nIn the ci action for setting up nix, I switched to use `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action` instead, as `nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action` currently doesn't support installing `nix` on macOS.\r\n\r\nI've also added a summary for workflows, since I'm a bit lazy to jump into ci steps to see what's going on everytime :joy:\r\n\r\n- **refactor nix configuration**\r\n- **use macos-latest(arm64) as ci runner**\r\n- **Add summary for github action**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

In the nix shell, `checksum` should be available instead of typing the whole path. \r\n\r\nIn the ci action for setting up nix, I switched to use `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action` instead, as `nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action` currently doesn't support installing `nix` on macOS.\r\n\r\nI've also added a summary for workflows, since I'm a bit lazy to jump into ci steps to see what's going on everytime :joy:\r\n\r\n- **refactor nix configuration**\r\n- **use macos-latest(arm64) as ci runner**\r\n- **Add summary for github action**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

In the nix shell, `checksum` should be available instead of typing the whole path. \r\n\r\nIn the ci action for setting up nix, I switched to use `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action` instead, as `nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action` currently doesn't support installing `nix` on macOS.\r\n\r\nI've also added a summary for workflows, since I'm a bit lazy to jump into ci steps to see what's going on everytime :joy:\r\n\r\n- **refactor nix configuration**\r\n- **use macos-latest(arm64) as ci runner**\r\n- **Add summary for github action**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review.
