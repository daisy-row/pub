We prefer assembly over intrinsics (for better control over register allocation and instruction scheduling), but all assembly should be as readable as possible and micro-optimization ideally deferred to automated tooling such as [SLOTHY](https://slothy-optimizer.github.io/slothy/). Ultimately, MLKEM-C-AArch64 strives for constant-time implementations for which the C-code is, at minimum, verified to be free of undefined behaviour, and where all assembly is functionally verified.\r\n\r\nMLKEM-C-AArch64 aims to provide a portfolio of implementations jointly providing competitive performance for most Armv8-A/Armv9-A microarchitectures. For some specific microarchitectures of particular interest, MLKEM-C-AArch64 may also provide CPU-specific implementations. Initially, our benchmarking platforms are:\r\n- Arm Cortex-A55\r\n- Arm Cortex-A72 (as used in the Raspberry Pi4)\r\n- Arm Cortex-A76 (as used in the Raspberry Pi5) / Neoverse N1 (as used in AWS Graviton2/c6g instances)\r\n- Arm Neoverse V1 (as used in the AWS Graviton3/c7g instances)\r\n- Apple M1\r\n\r\nPlease reach out to the MLKEM-C-AArch64 maintainers or open an issue if you would like to see benchmarking on other microarchitectures.\r\n\r\n## Non-goals\r\n\r\nAt this point, we do not provide implementations optimized for memory usage (code / RAM). If you need a memory-optimized implementation and the implementation provided by MLKEM-C-Generic is not of sufficient performance to your application, please contact us.\r\n\r\n## Relation to MLKEM-C-Generic\r\n\r\nEventually, we aim to unify the (shared) C-part of the implementations provided by MLKEM-C-AArch64 with the implementations in [mlkem-c-generic](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-generic). Initially, however, we will allow some divergence, e.g. to explore interfaces to 2-/4-/8-way parallel Keccak implementations which are essential for high-performance implementations of MLKEM.\r\n```","created_at":"2024-05-09T11:20:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T11:20:20Z","html_url":"https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pull/31#discussion_r1595319171","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/31","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/comments/1595319171"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pull/31#discussion_r1595319171"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/31"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/comments/1595319171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":5,"original_start_line":5,"start_side":"RIGHT","line":36,"original_line":36,"side":"RIGHT","original_position":39,"position":39,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/31","id":1829109178,"node_id":"PR_kwDOLh-nxs5tBf26","html_url":"https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pull/31","diff_url":"https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pull/31.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pull/31.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/31","number":31,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Describe
