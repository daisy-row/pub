Therefore the interface of the `tests` script is changed as follow (take command `func` for example):\r\n```\r\n> tests func --help                                                                                                                                                            \r\nUsage: tests func [OPTIONS] {stm32f4discovery}\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -v, --verbose             Show verbose output or not\r\n  -e, --emulate             Emulate on the QEMU or not\r\n  -i, --iterations INTEGER  Number of tests  [default: 1]\r\n  --help                    Show this message and exit.\r\n```\r\n\r\nTyping the full platform name is somehow tedious, I also added a shell hook to the nix shell, so that one can autocomplete with tabs.\r\n\r\n- libopencm3 nix cleanup\r\n- refactor with libopencm3 module gcc\r\n- refactor common gcc config for different platform\r\n- refactor RNG makefile config\r\n- add makefile config dependency\r\n- merge ci tests since there is no need for make clean between different configuration\r\n- move opencm3 configs inside mk/opencm3.mk\r\n- remove obj/libhal.a whenever dependencies changed\r\n- add platform as an optional argument to the test script\r\n- add shell completion for the tests script\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
