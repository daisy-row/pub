We'll keep track of them here, to make sure the dual-licenses are properly back-ported to pqm4/mupq. \r\n\r\nThere are some files based on public domain implementations of Keccak/FIPS202, e.g., https://github.com/mupq/mupq/blob/master/common/keccakf1600.c. \r\nThe original implementations are public domain, and the modifications are covered by the mupq/pqm4 CC0 waiver.\r\nI'm unsure how to properly handle those. Some input would be appreciated.
