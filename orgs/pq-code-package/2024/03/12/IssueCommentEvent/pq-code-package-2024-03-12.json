But I'd see this as low priority.\r\n\r\n> * How would you want to start the repository\r\n\r\nWe'd start with a copy of the Kyber reference implementation, add a buildsystem for the Cortex-M4 (e.g., the STM32F407G-DISC1), add some basic tests and benchmarks, and apply the stack and speed-optimizations using C for as much as possible.\r\nThe goal would be to have something functional by tomorrow night and a list of issues of the tasks left that we can work on over the coming weeks.\r\n\r\n> * A full or partial repo move from pqm4 -- this will need more discussion. I think it comes down to whether you need/want/can preserve history. I'd err on keeping the new repo fresh.\r\n\r\nNo, it does not make sense to move the repo.\r\nThis is only going to be a very small part of pqm4, and I'd like to keep the licenses much cleaner than in pqm4.\r\nThis means we will have to rewrite quite a bit of code in there and at the same time will try to write portable code rather than M4-specific assembly whereever possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/comments/1991261854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-12T10:12:32Z","org":{"id":158063050,"login":"pq-code-package","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pq-code-package","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158063050?"}}

The library will have both stack optimizations and speed optimizations for 32-bit platforms. The first goal is to take the state-of-the-art Cortex-M4 implementations (in [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4) ) and turn them into portable production-grade Apache-2.0-licensed implementations. Where needed (inline-)assembly will be added to achieve best performance while keeping the generic portable implementations as an option. In the long term, the goal is to optimize for more 32-bit platforms. Obvious choices would be 32-bit RISC-V (e.g, [HiFive1](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b))  or any of Arm Cortex-M3, Arm Cortex-M7, Arm Cortex-M55, Arm Cortex-M85. It will depend on contributors which platforms will be considered.\r\n\r\n**License**: ~MIT~ Apache-2.0\r\n**Access**: \r\n - Admin: @mkannwischer \r\n - Maintainer: @mkannwischer \r\n - Core contributors: @mkannwischer [@potsrevennil](https://github.com/potsrevennil)\r\n\r\n**Existing code**: https://github.com/mupq/pqm4 based on https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/tree/standard (However, the license situation in pqm4 is not ideal, so I do expect that we'll have to reimplement certain parts to be able to license everything under Apache-2.0.)\r\n\r\n**Call for contributors**: We are looking for co-maintainers and contributors to help drive this library forward. If you are interested, please reach out to me!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/21/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/comments/1991784188","html_url":"https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/21#issuecomment-1991784188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/21","id":1991784188,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLNiASM52uDb8","user":{"login":"rpls","id":751884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTg4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/751884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls","html_url":"https://github.com/rpls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rpls/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T14:29:06Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T14:29:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I can definitely contribute to some smaller degree this year, mostly in the area of platform & build support.
