The library will have both stack optimizations and speed optimizations for 32-bit platforms. The first goal is to take the state-of-the-art Cortex-M4 implementations (in [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4) ) and turn them into portable production-grade MIT-licensed implementations. Where needed (inline-)assembly will be added to achieve best performance while keeping the generic portable implementations as an option. In the long term, the goal is to optimize for more 32-bit platforms. Obvious choices would be 32-bit RISC-V (e.g, [HiFive1](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b))  or any of Arm Cortex-M3, Arm Cortex-M7, Arm Cortex-M55, Arm Cortex-M85.

The first goal is to take the state-of-the-art Cortex-M4 implementations (in [pqm4](https://github.com/mupq/pqm4) ) and turn them into portable production-grade Apache-2.0-licensed implementations. Where needed (inline-)assembly will be added to achieve best performance while keeping the generic portable implementations as an option. In the long term, the goal is to optimize for more 32-bit platforms. Obvious choices would be 32-bit RISC-V (e.g, [HiFive1](https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive1-rev-b))  or any of Arm Cortex-M3, Arm Cortex-M7, Arm Cortex-M55, Arm Cortex-M85.
