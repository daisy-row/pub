Can you also each run it maybe 3 times and post the results here , so we can make sure we are getting stable results? \r\n\r\nCurrently this requires to be run as the `root` user, so I added a flag `--run-as-root` to the benchmarking script, but this may require the user to enter a password. If anyone knows a way to use performance counters on Apple Silicon without using `sudo`, please do let me know. \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this code has caused me significant pain. \r\nThe original code contains two calls to `configure_rdtsc()` right after each other. I thought this must be a mistake and naively removed one of the calls. This resulted in the code working fine on a M1 MacMini, but reporting wrong numbers (like 0/1/2/3/4 cycles rather than serveral 10ks) on mulitple different MacBooks we have tried.\r\nAfter some trial-and-error, we found out that the calls within  `configure_rdtsc()` seem to be in the wrong order resulting in some of them being ineffective on the first invocation (on some devices). \r\nThis is fixed by reordering\r\n`kpc_set_config`, `kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`\r\nto \r\n`kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`, `kpc_set_config`.\r\nThanks @hanno-becker for helping me with that!\r\n\r\nThen it should work with a single call to `configure_rdtsc`.","created_at":"2024-06-27T09:49:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T10:04:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6e9d42e3451b719f4c89fbdbb4dd9ac850a1030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/81/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","head":{"label":"mkannwischer:m1cycles","ref":"m1cycles","sha":"2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","user":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":788351660,"node_id":"R_kgDOLv1KrA","name":"mlkem-c-aarch64","full_name":"mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/commi

Can you also each run it maybe 3 times and post the results here , so we can make sure we are getting stable results? \r\n\r\nCurrently this requires to be run as the `root` user, so I added a flag `--run-as-root` to the benchmarking script, but this may require the user to enter a password. If anyone knows a way to use performance counters on Apple Silicon without using `sudo`, please do let me know. \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this code has caused me significant pain. \r\nThe original code contains two calls to `configure_rdtsc()` right after each other. I thought this must be a mistake and naively removed one of the calls. This resulted in the code working fine on a M1 MacMini, but reporting wrong numbers (like 0/1/2/3/4 cycles rather than serveral 10ks) on mulitple different MacBooks we have tried.\r\nAfter some trial-and-error, we found out that the calls within  `configure_rdtsc()` seem to be in the wrong order resulting in some of them being ineffective on the first invocation (on some devices). \r\nThis is fixed by reordering\r\n`kpc_set_config`, `kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`\r\nto \r\n`kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`, `kpc_set_config`.\r\nThanks @hanno-becker for helping me with that!\r\n\r\nThen it should work with a single call to `configure_rdtsc`.","created_at":"2024-06-27T09:49:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T10:14:23Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6e9d42e3451b719f4c89fbdbb4dd9ac850a1030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/81/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","head":{"label":"mkannwischer:m1cycles","ref":"m1cycles","sha":"2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","user":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":788351660,"node_id":"R_kgDOLv1KrA","name":"mlkem-c-aarch64","full_name":"mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/commi

adds M1 benchmarking code based on based on https://gist.github.com/dougallj/5bafb113492047c865c0c8cfbc930155. \r\n\r\n@potsrevennil @hanno-becker, please test this on your M1 devices. Can you also each run it maybe 3 times and post the results here , so we can make sure we are getting stable results? \r\n\r\nCurrently this requires to be run as the `root` user, so I added a flag `--run-as-root` to the benchmarking script, but this may require the user to enter a password. If anyone knows a way to use performance counters on Apple Silicon without using `sudo`, please do let me know. \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this code has caused me significant pain. \r\nThe original code contains two calls to `configure_rdtsc()` right after each other. I thought this must be a mistake and naively removed one of the calls. This resulted in the code working fine on a M1 MacMini, but reporting wrong numbers (like 0/1/2/3/4 cycles rather than serveral 10ks) on mulitple different MacBooks we have tried.\r\nAfter some trial-and-error, we found out that the calls within  `configure_rdtsc()` seem to be in the wrong order resulting in some of them being ineffective on the first invocation (on some devices). \r\nThis is fixed by reordering\r\n`kpc_set_config`, `kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`\r\nto \r\n`kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`,

If anyone knows a way to use performance counters on Apple Silicon without using `sudo`, please do let me know. \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this code has caused me significant pain. \r\nThe original code contains two calls to `configure_rdtsc()` right after each other. I thought this must be a mistake and naively removed one of the calls. This resulted in the code working fine on a M1 MacMini, but reporting wrong numbers (like 0/1/2/3/4 cycles rather than serveral 10ks) on mulitple different MacBooks we have tried.\r\nAfter some trial-and-error, we found out that the calls within  `configure_rdtsc()` seem to be in the wrong order resulting in some of them being ineffective on the first invocation (on some devices). \r\nThis is fixed by reordering\r\n`kpc_set_config`, `kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`\r\nto \r\n`kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`, `kpc_set_config`.\r\nThanks @hanno-becker for helping me with that!\r\n\r\nThen it should work with a single call to `configure_rdtsc`.","created_at":"2024-06-27T09:49:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T10:22:34Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6e9d42e3451b719f4c89fbdbb4dd9ac850a1030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/81/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","head":{"label":"mkannwischer:m1cycles","ref":"m1cycles","sha":"2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","user":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":788351660,"node_id":"R_kgDOLv1KrA","name":"mlkem-c-aarch64","full_name":"mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/commi

Can you also each run it maybe 3 times and post the results here , so we can make sure we are getting stable results? \r\n\r\nCurrently this requires to be run as the `root` user, so I added a flag `--run-as-root` to the benchmarking script, but this may require the user to enter a password. If anyone knows a way to use performance counters on Apple Silicon without using `sudo`, please do let me know. \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this code has caused me significant pain. \r\nThe original code contains two calls to `configure_rdtsc()` right after each other. I thought this must be a mistake and naively removed one of the calls. This resulted in the code working fine on a M1 MacMini, but reporting wrong numbers (like 0/1/2/3/4 cycles rather than serveral 10ks) on mulitple different MacBooks we have tried.\r\nAfter some trial-and-error, we found out that the calls within  `configure_rdtsc()` seem to be in the wrong order resulting in some of them being ineffective on the first invocation (on some devices). \r\nThis is fixed by reordering\r\n`kpc_set_config`, `kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`\r\nto \r\n`kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`, `kpc_set_config`.\r\nThanks @hanno-becker for helping me with that!\r\n\r\nThen it should work with a single call to `configure_rdtsc`.","created_at":"2024-06-27T09:49:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T10:22:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6e9d42e3451b719f4c89fbdbb4dd9ac850a1030","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/81/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/81/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","head":{"label":"mkannwischer:m1cycles","ref":"m1cycles","sha":"2adc843ae3231d40a80959115a0a915524cb2b34","user":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":788351660,"node_id":"R_kgDOLv1KrA","name":"mlkem-c-aarch64","full_name":"mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mkannwischer","id":3984960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3984960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer","html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkannwischer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkannwischer/mlkem-c-aarch64/commi
