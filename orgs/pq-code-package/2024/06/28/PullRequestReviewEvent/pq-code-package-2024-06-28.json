Can you also each run it maybe 3 times and post the results here , so we can make sure we are getting stable results?~ \r\nResults seem stable accross 4 different M1 devices (MacMini and various MacBook). \r\n\r\nTo run on the P-cores (Firestorm), run \r\n```\r\ntests bench -c M1 --run-as-root   \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run on the E-cores (Icestorm), run \r\n```\r\ntests bench -c M1 --run-as-root --mac-taskpolicy background\r\n```\r\n\r\nInternally this runs:\r\n```\r\ntaskpolicy -c background sudo ./test/bin/bench_kyberXXX\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this requires to be run as the `root` user, so I added a flag `--run-as-root` to the benchmarking script, but this may require the user to enter a password. If anyone knows a way to use performance counters on Apple Silicon without using `sudo`, please do let me know. \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that this code has caused me significant pain. \r\nThe original code contains two calls to `configure_rdtsc()` right after each other. I thought this must be a mistake and naively removed one of the calls. This resulted in the code working fine on a M1 MacMini, but reporting wrong numbers (like 0/1/2/3/4 cycles rather than serveral 10ks) on mulitple different MacBooks we have tried.\r\nAfter some trial-and-error, we found out that the calls within  `configure_rdtsc()` seem to be in the wrong order resulting in some of them being ineffective on the first invocation (on some devices). \r\nThis is fixed by reordering\r\n`kpc_set_config`, `kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`\r\nto \r\n`kpc_force_all_ctrs_set`, `kpc_set_counting`, `kpc_set_thread_counting`, `kpc_set_config`.\r\nThanks @hanno-becker for helping me with that!\r\n\r\nThen it should work with a single call to `configure_rdtsc`.","created_at":"2024-06-27T09:49:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T05:38:48Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efd7281ffccf9597f34c015c44109283cce4335b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7100825001,"node_id":"LA_kwDOLh-nxs8AAAABpz39qQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/labels/benchmark","name":"benchmark","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"this

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.
