Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
