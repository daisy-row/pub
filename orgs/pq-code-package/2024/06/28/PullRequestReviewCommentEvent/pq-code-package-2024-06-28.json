Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Additional context, some package manager like `pacman` in `archlinux` packed the gcc with glibc, so that compilation with `-static` works automatically in this case.\r\n\r\n@hanno-becker @mkannwischer Please have a look and see if the static compilation works, and the original usage won't break. The static compilation can be tested such as:\r\n```\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" make bench CYCLES=PERF # aarch64\r\nCFLAGS=\"-mcpu=cortex-a55 -march=armv8.2-a -static\" CROSS_PREFIX=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- make bench CYCLES=PERF # x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also cleanup the nix file a bit, hope that it can be more readable and easier to maintain.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.
