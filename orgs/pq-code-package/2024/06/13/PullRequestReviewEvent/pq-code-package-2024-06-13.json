This means it should only take 10 minutes once, and then consecutive builds should be as fast as loading it from the package manager. \r\nI tested here by re-running the CI jobs and it seems to work fine.\r\nIf we see any CI performance degradation in other PRs, I'll need to look more into the configuration of

This means it should only take 10 minutes once, and then consecutive builds should be as fast as loading it from the package manager. \r\nI tested here by re-running the CI jobs and it seems to work

This means it should only take 10 minutes once, and then consecutive builds should be as fast as loading it from the package manager. \r\nI tested here by re-running the CI jobs and it seems to work fine.\r\nIf we see any CI performance degradation in other PRs, I'll need to look more into the configuration of

This means it should only take 10 minutes once, and then consecutive builds should be as fast as loading it from the package manager. \r\nI tested here by re-running the CI jobs and it seems to work

We might want to add the capability to manually specify whether to run tests natively or on QEMU in the future. However, I don't think we need this functionality for now.\r\n\r\nUsage of the script is as follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> tests --help\r\nUsage: tests [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\r\n\r\nCommands:\r\n  func     Run the functional tests for all parameter sets\r\n  kat      Run the kat tests for all parameter sets\r\n  nistkat  Run the nistkat tests for all parameter sets\r\n  run      Run the specified binary file\r\n\r\n> tests nistkat --help\r\nUsage: tests nistkat [OPTIONS]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -v, --verbose  Show verbose output or not\r\n  --help         Show this message and exit.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also added `black` as the Python formatter and updated the `format` and `lint` scripts to utilize it for checking the format of Python scripts. I don't have a strong opinion on the choice of Python formatter, so if there are any better suggestions, I am open to using them.\r\n\r\n- **emulate arm64 binary on x86_64 machine**\r\n- **Output binaries to bin/ directory**\r\n- **add nistkat checksum back**\r\n- **use black for python formatting**\r\n- **add tests script for running a specify binary**\r\n- **factor out the common part of compiling and running a binary**\r\n- **add test command for func, nistkat and kat tests**\r\n- **compare tests result to the META file**\r\n- **add github step summary to tests script if the env var exists**\r\n- **update ci to use the tests script**\r\n- **cleanup**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Minor changes to the assembly implementation may be required. Specifically, for Keccak, we load individual vector registers, which necessitates a few additional vector permutation instructions.\n\n### Keccak Design Steps:\n\n1. User provides data for the input lane.\n2. User provides output for each lane.\n3. All lanes are absorbed simultaneously.\n4. All lanes are squeezed simultaneously.\n\n### Additional APIs for Single Lane Operations:\n\n```c\nuint64_t *keccakx_get_lane_state(keccakx *kx, size_t lane_index);\n```\n\nThis allows for retrieving the state of a specific lane for continued single Keccak operations.\n\n### Optimization Potential with Scatter-Gather Memory:\n\n- **Multiple Pass Squeezing**: Currently, if `rej_uniform` fails to sample the full vector size, it continues by squeezing a single Keccak lane. By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\nOriginally, the implementation of KeccakX used heap memory, but it has been converted to stack-only, which is more efficient.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Add Keccak_X_Way assembly to replace the `for loop` in `fips202x.c`.\n\nFixes

Minor changes to the assembly implementation may be required. Specifically, for Keccak, we load individual vector registers, which necessitates a few additional vector permutation instructions.\n\n### Keccak Design Steps:\n\n1. User provides data for the input lane.\n2. User provides output for each lane.\n3. All lanes are absorbed simultaneously.\n4. All lanes are squeezed simultaneously.\n\n### Additional APIs for Single Lane Operations:\n\n```c\nuint64_t *keccakx_get_lane_state(keccakx *kx, size_t lane_index);\n```\n\nThis allows for retrieving the state of a specific lane for continued single Keccak operations.\n\n### Optimization Potential with Scatter-Gather Memory:\n\n- **Multiple Pass Squeezing**: Currently, if `rej_uniform` fails to sample the full vector size, it continues by squeezing a single Keccak lane. By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\nOriginally, the implementation of KeccakX used heap memory, but it has been converted to stack-only, which is more efficient.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Add Keccak_X_Way assembly to replace the `for loop` in `fips202x.c`.\n\nFixes

Minor changes to the assembly implementation may be required. Specifically, for Keccak, we load individual vector registers, which necessitates a few additional vector permutation instructions.\n\n### Keccak Design Steps:\n\n1. User provides data for the input lane.\n2. User provides output for each lane.\n3. All lanes are absorbed simultaneously.\n4. All lanes are squeezed simultaneously.\n\n### Additional APIs for Single Lane Operations:\n\n```c\nuint64_t *keccakx_get_lane_state(keccakx *kx, size_t lane_index);\n```\n\nThis allows for retrieving the state of a specific lane for continued single Keccak operations.\n\n### Optimization Potential with Scatter-Gather Memory:\n\n- **Multiple Pass Squeezing**: Currently, if `rej_uniform` fails to sample the full vector size, it continues by squeezing a single Keccak lane. By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\nOriginally, the implementation of KeccakX used heap memory, but it has been converted to stack-only, which is more efficient.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Add Keccak_X_Way assembly to replace the `for loop` in `fips202x.c`.\n\nFixes
