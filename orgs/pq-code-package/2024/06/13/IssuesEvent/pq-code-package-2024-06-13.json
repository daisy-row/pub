For example, formatting poly.c yields:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < KYBER_N / 8; i++)\r\n        __CPROVER_assigns(i, u, __CPROVER_object_whole(t), __CPROVER_object_whole(r))\r\n        __CPROVER_loop_invariant(i <= KYBER_N) {\r\n```\r\nwhich makes it hard to edit the invariant without accidentially losing or mis-placing the opening brace.\r\n\r\nWith \"bsd\" style, this comes out as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    for (size_t i = 0; i < KYBER_N / 8; i++)\r\n        __CPROVER_assigns(i, u, __CPROVER_object_whole(t), __CPROVER_object_whole(r))\r\n        __CPROVER_loop_invariant(i <= KYBER_N)\r\n    {\r\n```\r\nso that lines of the invariant can be added, removed or edited without fear of damaging the location of the brace.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/mlkem-c-aarch64/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-13T12:01:51Z","org":{"id":158063050,"login":"pq-code-package","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pq-code-package","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158063050?"}}
