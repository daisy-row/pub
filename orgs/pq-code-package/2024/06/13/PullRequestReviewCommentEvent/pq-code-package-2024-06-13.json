This means it should only take 10 minutes once, and then consecutive builds should be as fast as loading it from the package manager. \r\nI tested here by re-running the CI jobs and it seems to work fine.\r\nIf we see any CI performance degradation in other PRs, I'll need to look more into the configuration of

This means it should only take 10 minutes once, and then consecutive builds should be as fast as loading it from the package manager. \r\nI tested here by re-running the CI jobs and it seems to work fine.\r\nIf we see any CI performance degradation in other PRs, I'll need to look more into the configuration of

Minor changes to the assembly implementation may be required. Specifically, for Keccak, we load individual vector registers, which necessitates a few additional vector permutation instructions.\n\n### Keccak Design Steps:\n\n1. User provides data for the input lane.\n2. User provides output for each lane.\n3. All lanes are absorbed simultaneously.\n4. All lanes are squeezed simultaneously.\n\n### Additional APIs for Single Lane Operations:\n\n```c\nuint64_t *keccakx_get_lane_state(keccakx *kx, size_t lane_index);\n```\n\nThis allows for retrieving the state of a specific lane for continued single Keccak operations.\n\n### Optimization Potential with Scatter-Gather Memory:\n\n- **Multiple Pass Squeezing**: Currently, if `rej_uniform` fails to sample the full vector size, it continues by squeezing a single Keccak lane. By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\nOriginally, the implementation of KeccakX used heap memory, but it has been converted to stack-only, which is more efficient.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Add Keccak_X_Way assembly to replace the `for loop` in `fips202x.c`.\n\nFixes

Minor changes to the assembly implementation may be required. Specifically, for Keccak, we load individual vector registers, which necessitates a few additional vector permutation instructions.\n\n### Keccak Design Steps:\n\n1. User provides data for the input lane.\n2. User provides output for each lane.\n3. All lanes are absorbed simultaneously.\n4. All lanes are squeezed simultaneously.\n\n### Additional APIs for Single Lane Operations:\n\n```c\nuint64_t *keccakx_get_lane_state(keccakx *kx, size_t lane_index);\n```\n\nThis allows for retrieving the state of a specific lane for continued single Keccak operations.\n\n### Optimization Potential with Scatter-Gather Memory:\n\n- **Multiple Pass Squeezing**: Currently, if `rej_uniform` fails to sample the full vector size, it continues by squeezing a single Keccak lane. By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\nOriginally, the implementation of KeccakX used heap memory, but it has been converted to stack-only, which is more efficient.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Add Keccak_X_Way assembly to replace the `for loop` in `fips202x.c`.\n\nFixes

Minor changes to the assembly implementation may be required. Specifically, for Keccak, we load individual vector registers, which necessitates a few additional vector permutation instructions.\n\n### Keccak Design Steps:\n\n1. User provides data for the input lane.\n2. User provides output for each lane.\n3. All lanes are absorbed simultaneously.\n4. All lanes are squeezed simultaneously.\n\n### Additional APIs for Single Lane Operations:\n\n```c\nuint64_t *keccakx_get_lane_state(keccakx *kx, size_t lane_index);\n```\n\nThis allows for retrieving the state of a specific lane for continued single Keccak operations.\n\n### Optimization Potential with Scatter-Gather Memory:\n\n- **Multiple Pass Squeezing**: Currently, if `rej_uniform` fails to sample the full vector size, it continues by squeezing a single Keccak lane. By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\nOriginally, the implementation of KeccakX used heap memory, but it has been converted to stack-only, which is more efficient.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n- Add Keccak_X_Way assembly to replace the `for loop` in `fips202x.c`.\n\nFixes
