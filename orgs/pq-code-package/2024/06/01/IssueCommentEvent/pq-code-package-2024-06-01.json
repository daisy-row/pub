The C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC) is a tool which can prove absence of various classes of undefined behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis commit is a first step towards using CBMC to harden MLKEM-C-AArch64.\r\n\r\n- Setup CBMC boilerplate using cbmc-starter-kit: All proof harnesses, scripts and Makefiles needed to run CBMC are in the `cbmc/` directory. Harnesses are organized by the (main) function to which they apply, and stored in separate directories with the name of the function.\r\n- Demonstrate the use of CBMC in the example of the decompression funcion `poly_decompress`: Specify (in natural language, in a function contract, and in the test harness) that the coefficients in the output polynomial of this function are unsigned canonical.\r\n- Guided by CBMC, make smaller changes to `poly_decompress` to avoid integer truncation warnings. The previous code did _not_ trigger undefined behaviour to my understanding (signed -> unsigned conversions are always defined), but it is arguably still better style to make truncations explicit.\r\n- Run CBMC in CI\r\n\r\nTo run the `poly_decompress` proofs along:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd cbmc/proofs/poly_decompress\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run all CBMC tests (only `poly_decompress` so far, but more will hopefully be added) and print a summary,\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd cbmc/proofs\r\nKYBER_K={2,3,4} run-cbmc-proofs.py --summarize\r\n```\r\n\r\n[//]: # (SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0)\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
