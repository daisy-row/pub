The `tests` script is also refactored a bit in order to show the benchmark summary on GitHub action.\r\n\r\nI refactored the `nix` shell specification in order to speed up ci, and also\r\ndisabled ci jobs running on self-host runner when pushed to fork repositories by the way.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.
