By rewriting this logic to append single Keccak calls into a single Keccak X-way call, CPU cycles can be saved. For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps:\r\n\r\n- Add Keccak_X4 assembly to replace the `keccak_absorb_x4keccak_squeezeblocks_x4` in

For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps:\r\n\r\n- Add Keccak_X4 assembly to replace the `keccak_absorb_x4keccak_squeezeblocks_x4` in

For simplicity, it is currently implemented as a single pass.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps:\r\n\r\n- Add Keccak_X4 assembly to replace the `keccak_absorb_x4keccak_squeezeblocks_x4` in
