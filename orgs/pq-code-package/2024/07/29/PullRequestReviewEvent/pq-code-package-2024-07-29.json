Utilization of `pkgCross.aarch-multiplatform`:\r\n- The `pkgCross.aarch-multiplatform` package in `Nix` is now used to set up `GCC` targeting the `AArch64` platform. This change enhances clarity and simplicity.\r\n- The cumbersome `arm-gnu-gcc.nix` file can thus be removed.\r\n- Note: `AArch64` `macOS` will continue using the native `Clang` compiler as per the original setup.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Cross Prefix Modification:\r\n- The cross prefix for GCC in `pkgCross.aarch-multiplatform` has changed from `aarch64-none-linux-gnu-` to `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-`.\r\n- To accommodate this, the test script has been updated to allow users to specify the cross prefix they are using.\r\n\r\n#### 3. CI Configuration Refactor:\r\n\r\n- The CI configuration has been streamlined by utilizing GitHub defaults for setting up the Nix shell, thereby avoiding multiple shell declarations.\r\n\r\n[//]: # (SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0)\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
