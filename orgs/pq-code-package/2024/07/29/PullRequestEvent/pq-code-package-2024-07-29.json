I instead re-implemented it using Arm [ACLE](https://arm-software.github.io/acle/main/acle.html).\r\n\r\nThere are some differences to the implementation in [1]/pqm4:\r\n - Arm ACLE does not support `smulwb`, so we have to use `__smlawb(a, b, 0);` (I tried to make gcc issue `smulwb` in a different way, but it seems it simply does not know the instruction - with clang I did succeed however).  \r\n - Arm ACLE does not support `pkhtb`, so I reimplemented it myself as `#define __pkhtb(a, b) (((uint32_t)a) & 0xFFFF0000) ^ (((b) >> 16) & 0xFFFF)`, but gcc isn't able to issue the correct instruction. It uses `bfc+orr` (With clang I do get `pkhtb` when using that macro). \r\n - gcc does not like to spill to the FPU registers here, so the 4 merged layers in the inverse NTT are not optimal. I instead split that into two loops.\r\n - I have not yet implemented asymmetric multiplication proposed in https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/986.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is some stats on the performance on the STM32F407:\r\n\r\n| routine           | ref        | [1] / pqm4 | ACLE |\r\n| ------------------- | --------- |---------------- | ------- |\r\n| NTT                 | 33775 |  4483           | 8077 |\r\n| iNTT                | 48207 | 4828            | 8413 |\r\n| basemul         | 14995 | 2449            | 3426 |\r\n| basemul_acc | 16088  | 2833           | 4070 |\r\n\r\nNote that the overall performance is still very poor due to the slow Keccak permutation.\r\n\r\nYou may ask why I would want rewrite that code using ACLE that instead of just pulling in the assembly. Two reasons: (1) I wanted to know how close you can get to handwritten assembly (answer: not very close); (2) the current M4 assembly is known to perform relatively poorly on newer CPUs (e.g., the Cortex-M7) due to scheduling and we are currently working on faster code and I wanted to have some comparison. My expectation is that the compiler will do quite a poor job for the Cortex-M7 as well, but we'll see. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]

Utilization of `pkgCross.aarch-multiplatform`:\r\n- The `pkgCross.aarch-multiplatform` package in `Nix` is now used to set up `GCC` targeting the `AArch64` platform. This change enhances clarity and simplicity.\r\n- The cumbersome `arm-gnu-gcc.nix` file can thus be removed.\r\n- Note: `AArch64` `macOS` will continue using the native `Clang` compiler as per the original setup.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Cross Prefix Modification:\r\n- The cross prefix for GCC in `pkgCross.aarch-multiplatform` has changed from `aarch64-none-linux-gnu-` to `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-`.\r\n- To accommodate this, the test script has been updated to allow users to specify the cross prefix they are using.\r\n\r\n#### 3. CI Configuration Refactor:\r\n\r\n- The CI configuration has been streamlined by utilizing GitHub defaults for setting up the Nix shell, thereby avoiding multiple shell declarations.\r\n\r\n[//]: # (SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0)\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
