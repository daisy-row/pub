In Rust we can define that with traits, in C that's a little hard to do. That's why we usually use de-randomised versions for integration.\n- There's another API that does not serialise all the keys (unpacked keys) that is faster and folks may want to use in many cases (like TLS).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/comments/2228072893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-15T09:31:43Z","org":{"id":158063050,"login":"pq-code-package","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pq-code-package","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158063050?"}}
