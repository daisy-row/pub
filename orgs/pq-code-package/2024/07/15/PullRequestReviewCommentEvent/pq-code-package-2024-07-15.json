Spencer will be working on this and may contact Matthias for advice.\n+\n+#### mlkem-rust-libcrux\n+\n+* Franziskus has been working on separating out the code upstream ie into different crates. Working through policies such as when code is pushed, issue tracking, which crate is where, dependencies (small number).
