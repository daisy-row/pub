The first one is a product owned by Microsoft using closed source software on their servers. Of course GitHub do use \"git\" under the hood somewhere.\r\n\r\n> There is nothing wrong with having a remote/mirror on another host.\r\n\r\nI disagree. Having mirrors is IMHO hazardous to a project because it do split attention and resources. Decide for one.\r\n\r\n> GitHub has more visibility to more developers than any other host.\r\n\r\nThis is IMHO not how FOSS works. The visibility of a project do not depend on the platform they use. This is not Facebook or Tiktok. From an advertising point of view the used code hoster is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n> Right now, what Post-Quantum Security needs more than anything else is visibility and awareness across every developer ecosystem and across the cybersecurity industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd it needs trust in expertise. Using Microsoft GitHub do not establish trust in the expertise and decisions of this repository maintainers. Closed source on the servers. Servers in USA. Hard- and software owned by US-company treating users as products, selling their data, ignoring their needs and cooperating with 5-eyes. You can not establish trust in a project when it is hosted on a platform having the NSA & Co in the back.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/comments/1937797752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-11T16:14:19Z","org":{"id":158063050,"login":"pq-code-package","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pq-code-package","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158063050?"}}
