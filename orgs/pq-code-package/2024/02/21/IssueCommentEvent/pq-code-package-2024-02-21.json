For example this could be auto-generated from a yaml file in each repo and added into the pqca repo in markdown (?mkdocs - or any other recommended way) to further improve searching\n\nYES.  This can be on a website or in the TSC repo proper.  TSC can pull together a matrix for those libraries that conveys or pulls some of this from the repository so there is a single central point when someone is trying to understand what options are available to them, if they are in development, stable, prod ready, etc.\n\n> test searchability in search engines\n\nThis may be some SEO work that can be passed to the PQCA staff to assist with.
