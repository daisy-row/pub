How strict that requirement is will be a question for the PQCP contributors and TSC as they start seeing each implementation and goals, but I hope that it will move towards being as similar as possible.  One inherent restriction to that commonality will be that there will be implementations in different languages -- C, Rust, maybe Go and more -- which obviously have not only their own syntax but also their own conventions.  But if there are multiple implementations within one language (e.g., C / assembly), then it seems quite prudent to aim for those to have the same API, like PQClean does.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/comments/1968966567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-28T13:17:56Z","org":{"id":158063050,"login":"pq-code-package","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pq-code-package","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158063050?"}}
