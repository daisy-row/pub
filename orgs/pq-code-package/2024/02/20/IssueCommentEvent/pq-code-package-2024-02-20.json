Language is often (not always) the next constraint. I have a primarily rust app, that's what I want to use. That being said I can imagine any of the other criteria - level of assurance, optimizations for performance, memory size, architecture are all really relevant too. \r\n\r\nOverall I like the scheme proposed. ensuring some key criteria are in the name, somewhere, helps with filtering repos (but we shouldn't have too long names?). Especially as we get further right in the name I think we can be less prescriptive as we're trying to condense a lot into a small space!\r\n\r\nWe can also\r\n - ensure we tag each repo appropriately ie using well-known tags where they exist\r\n - ensuring the top level readme addresses the key search criteria early on (first 'page') to help people scanning through\r\n - catalog our repos so that at least once here we explain the difference between the repos and address these characteristics, perhaps in a table. For example this could be auto-generated from a yaml file in each repo and added into the pqca repo in markdown (?mkdocs - or any other recommended way) to further improve searching\r\n - test searchability in search engines","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/comments/1954154869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-20T12:52:49Z","org":{"id":158063050,"login":"pq-code-package","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pq-code-package","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158063050?"}}
