We have developed a sister project, [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/), which is meant to contain standalone C implementations of individual PQ algorithms; that repository has lots of automated tests that are run on the code on more platforms than we are testing liboqs on at the moment.  But PQClean is not a library, it's standalone implementations; liboqs will wrap them all together in a library, and then continue with the TLS/SSH/... prototypes.  \r\n\r\nLast night I actually spent a couple of hours preparing one of the NTRU Prime algorithms (ntrulpr653) for PQClean based on the [Round 2 submission ZIP](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/documents/round-2/submissions/NTRU-Prime-Round2.zip).  I think that first algorithm is mostly done ([see branch](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/tree/ntru-prime)), and now it's a matter of doing the remaining NTRU LPR and Streamlined NTRU algorithms for PQClean.  Once they're in PQClean, it's pretty straightforward to add to liboqs.\r\n\r\nWould you want to finish off the NTRU Prime algorithms for PQClean?  We can have a quick call or email exchange if you want more of an explanation."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-04-16T14:25:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
