been investigating the cause of the current build failure. It seems to be an algorithm problem: different KAT values are generated for FrodoKEM-640-AES when using Configuration=Debug versus Configuration=Release.  In particular, the `S` value generated during sampling `PQCLEAN_FRODOKEM640AES_CLEAN_sample_n` is different.\r\n\r\nThis suggests a problem in the upstream PQClean code or even the upstream LWEKE code from @patricklonga.  @christianpaquin, do you know what the difference is between Configuration=Debug and Configuration=Release?  Is there a way to replicate that directly in the command-line when compiling with cl.exe (which is how we do tests on Windows in PQClean, see e.g. [Makefile.Microsoft\\_nmake](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/crypto_kem/frodokem640aes/clean/Makefile.Microsoft_nmake)).  If so, then I'd be curious to first replicate Configuration=Release onto the PQClean Makefile.Microsoft\\_nmake and see whether it produces different KAT values there (which would suggest the problem is in the Frodo code) or not (which would suggest the problem is in the liboqs AES or SHA-3 code)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-05-01T22:00:53Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
