It may be the case after the end of the NIST competition that some higher level standards bodies may come up with different substructures and encodings, but for now the byte strings from the original NIST submissions are definitive."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-06-29T01:12:29Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
