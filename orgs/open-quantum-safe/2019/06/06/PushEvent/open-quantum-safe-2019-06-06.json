In order to avoid underflow it first adds 32p mod p\n(which is equivalent to 0 mod p) to |out|. The comments and variable naming\nsuggest that the original author intended to add 64p mod p. In fact it\nhas been shown that with certain unusual co-ordinates it is possible to\ncause an underflow in this function when only adding 32p mod p while\nperforming a point double operation. By changing this to 64p mod p the\nunderflow is avoided.\n\nIt turns out to be quite difficult to construct points that satisfy the\nunderflow criteria although this has been done and the underflow\ndemonstrated. However none of these points are actually on the curve.\nFinding points that satisfy the underflow criteria and are also *on* the\ncurve is considered significantly more difficult. For this reason we do\nnot believe that this issue is currently practically exploitable and\ntherefore no CVE has been assigned.\n\nThis only impacts builds using the enable-ec_nistp_64_gcc_128 Configure\noption.\n\nWith thanks to Bo-Yin Yang, Billy Brumley and Dr Liu for their significant\nhelp in investigating this issue.\n\nReviewed-by: Nicola Tuveri <nic.tuv@gmail.com>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8405)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 13fbce17fc9f02e2401fc3868f3f8e02d6647e5f)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/d5e37fc871be6910db931790b70323c78b332dff"},{"sha":"6555a8941bd6be5790d3b45c41de23234a8e527f","author":{"name":"Bernd Edlinger","email":"ac6902843ae77cc0d49b9c8ddec4cbf141db1bb7@hotmail.de"},"message":"Fix memory overrun in rsa padding check functions\n\nBackported from d7f5e5ae6d5\n\nFixes #8364 and #8357\n\nReviewed-by: Kurt Roeckx <kurt@roeckx.be>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8438)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/6555a8941bd6be5790d3b45c41de23234a8e527f"},{"sha":"dbf71ae457dfa5632518612b58efccd40f528f26","author":{"name":"Bernd Edlinger","email":"ac6902843ae77cc0d49b9c8ddec4cbf141db1bb7@hotmail.de"},"message":"Clear the secret point in ecdh_compute_key\n\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8502)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/dbf71ae457dfa5632518612b58efccd40f528f26"},{"sha":"94eb7d07c0c14bf18bd3a4e4d6c1ef1e6633d447","author":{"name":"Bernd Edlinger","email":"ac6902843ae77cc0d49b9c8ddec4cbf141db1bb7@hotmail.de"},"message":"Clear the point S before freeing in ec_mul_consttime\n\nThe secret point R can be recovered from S using the equation R = S - P.\nThe X and Z coordinates should be sufficient for that.\n\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8505)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 502b871ad4eacc96a31f89d9a9470ca2858da998)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/94eb7d07c0c14bf18bd3a4e4d6c1ef1e6633d447"},{"sha":"d284d277707f9985e69bdba1511ecfbb1e53ac46","author":{"name":"Bernd Edlinger","email":"ac6902843ae77cc0d49b9c8ddec4cbf141db1bb7@hotmail.de"},"message":"Make err_clear_constant_time really constant time\n\n[extended tests]\n\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8558)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/d284d277707f9985e69bdba1511ecfbb1e53ac46"},{"sha":"c3e7beab2a302e3eff45b156751240d0897d50f5","author":{"name":"Bernd Edlinger","email":"ac6902843ae77cc0d49b9c8ddec4cbf141db1bb7@hotmail.de"},"message":"Modify the RSA_private_decrypt functions to check the padding in\nconstant time with a memory access pattern that does not depend\non secret information.\n\n[extended tests]\n\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8543)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 9c0cf214e7836eb5aaf1ea5d3cbf6720533f86b5)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/c3e7beab2a302e3eff45b156751240d0897d50f5"},{"sha":"d3299a33e5acdf61502755d807d5885c17c46003","author":{"name":"Shane Lontis","email":"452ce16516ceed26291fe7de3f8b53540d83864e@oracle.com"},"message":"fixed public range check in ec_GF2m_simple_oct2point\n\nReviewed-by: Matt Caswell <matt@openssl.org>\nReviewed-by: Bernd Edlinger <bernd.edlinger@hotmail.de>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8607)\n\n(cherry picked from commit cad8347be23c5e0c0d9eea02d090d42daf2dd7a9)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/d3299a33e5acdf61502755d807d5885c17c46003"},{"sha":"f937540ec40a5e838460b8f19d2eb722529126b8","author":{"name":"Dr. Matthias St. Pierre","email":"1910231d24f125aceac7850dc92279eee8d52323@ncp-e.com"},"message":"Add FIPS support for Android Arm 64-bit\n\nFixes #2490\nFixes #8711\n\nIn commit 6db8e3bdc9e, support for Android Arm 64-bit was added to\nthe OpenSSL FIPS Object Module.

RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV)\nshould be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and\nfront pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it\nalso incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case\nonly the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are\nignored.\n\nIt is a requirement of using this cipher that nonce values are unique.\nMessages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious\nconfidentiality and integrity attacks. If an application changes the\ndefault nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then makes a change to\nthe leading bytes of the nonce expecting the new value to be a new unique\nnonce then such an application could inadvertently encrypt messages with a\nreused nonce.\n\nAdditionally the ignored bytes in a long nonce are not covered by the\nintegrity guarantee of this cipher. Any application that relies on the\nintegrity of these ignored leading bytes of a long nonce may be further\naffected.\n\nAny OpenSSL internal use of this cipher, including in SSL/TLS, is safe\nbecause no such use sets such a long nonce value. However user\napplications that use this cipher directly and set a non-default nonce\nlength to be longer than 12 bytes may be vulnerable.\n\nCVE-2019-1543\n\nFixes #8345\n\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\nReviewed-by: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8406)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2a3d0ee9d59156c48973592331404471aca886d6)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/f426625b6ae9a7831010750490a5f0ad689c5ba3"},{"sha":"9b10d1bf77b734f15c4ed5d1b619cd598b7c13fc","author":{"name":"Matt Caswell","email":"1fa2ef4755a9226cb9a0a4840bd89b158ac71391@openssl.org"},"message":"Test an overlong ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce\n\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\nReviewed-by: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/8406)\n\n(cherry picked from commit a4f0b50eafb256bb802f2724fc7f7580fb0fbabc)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/commits/9b10d1bf77b734f15c4ed5d1b619cd598b7c13fc"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-06-06T15:23:18Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
