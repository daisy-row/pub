trying to test this with regards to #128 but I'm having a problem. I'm following the build instructions and building both liboqs and openssl only as static and not shared libs, but `make install` for OpenSSL complains `install: cannot stat 'oqs/lib/liboqs.so.0.0.0': No such file or directory`. It shouldn't be looking for this file in this configuration. \r\n\r\nWhen configuring everything to build shared libraries, `make install` works fine. I see the OQS header files are now installed in `$(openssldir)/include/oqs` in that case."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-12-12T23:07:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
