I am not sure how to further debug the error, as searching for the gcc commands using grep did not find the correct line. What could I do to solve the issue and install the library?\r\n\r\n```\r\n${LDCMD:-gcc} -pthread -m64 -Ioqs/include -Wa,--noexecstack -Wall -O3 -L. -Loqs/lib  \\\r\n\t-o test/buildtest_c_srp test/buildtest_srp.o \\\r\n\t -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -pthread -loqs -lm\r\nrm -f test/buildtest_c_txt_db\r\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -loqs\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it an issue with the capital, as using -Loqs does not seem to throw any errors! Perhaps you'll find the problem quicker, as if I spend more time trying to identify the problem. Should oqs be placed as loqs?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nCob"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/569877811","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/135#issuecomment-569877811","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/135","id":569877811,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTg3NzgxMQ==","user":{"login":"CobbleVision","id":39296163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Mjk2MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/39296163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision","html_url":"https://github.com/CobbleVision","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CobbleVision/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-31T07:05:17Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T07:05:17Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the support so far. Using nm does not show any QSC symbols / algs. I checked manually as well as with grep. \r\n\r\nI'll retry to build the library in the coming days on a different system.
