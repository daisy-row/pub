I am not sure how to further debug the error, as searching for the gcc commands using grep did not find the correct line. What could I do to solve the issue and install the library?\r\n\r\n```\r\n${LDCMD:-gcc} -pthread -m64 -Ioqs/include -Wa,--noexecstack -Wall -O3 -L. -Loqs/lib  \\\r\n\t-o test/buildtest_c_srp test/buildtest_srp.o \\\r\n\t -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -pthread -loqs -lm\r\nrm -f test/buildtest_c_txt_db\r\n/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -loqs\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it an issue with the capital, as using -Loqs does not seem to throw any errors! Perhaps you'll find the problem quicker, as if I spend more time trying to identify the problem. Should oqs be placed as loqs?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMark C.
