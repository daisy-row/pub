I just checked your log files again and they show indeed a correctly built and linking openssl. I can't understand how/why it shouldn't list the QSC algs... Can you run `nm` on your apps/openssl executable to see whether QSC symbols are in there (e.g., `OQS_SIG_dilithium_2_new`)?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'd recommend a clean-slate start, doing everything without `sudo` up to and _excluding_ `make install` in the `OpenSSL` build folder. What works fine for me is cloning and building liboqs and openssl in two separate folders next to each other.\r\n\r\nLast alternative, if you're into Docker, you might want to give an \"experimental\" feature a try and run `docker run -it openqsafe/liboqs-ubuntu-bionic-dev` which should give you a root shell into a Docker image with a 'conservatively' (i.e., non-'/usr') built-and-installed OQS-openssl (and all required libraries for building further apps on top)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-12-30T14:31:03Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
