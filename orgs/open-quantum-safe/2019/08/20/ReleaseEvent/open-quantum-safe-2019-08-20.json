More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.\r\n\r\n**liboqs-cpp** is an open source C++ wrapper for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs-cpp can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis release of liboqs-cpp was released on August 20, 2019. Its release page on GitHub is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/releases/tag/0.2.0-rc1.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor a list of changes see [CHANGES.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).\r\n\r\nThis solution implements a header-only C++ wrapper in C++11 for the C OQS library. It contains the main header file for the wrapper, as well as examples, documentation, and unit tests.\r\n\r\nliboqs-cpp can be compiled against liboqs master branch, and makes available all digital signature schemes and key encapsulation mechanisms from liboqs.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-08-20T15:28:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
