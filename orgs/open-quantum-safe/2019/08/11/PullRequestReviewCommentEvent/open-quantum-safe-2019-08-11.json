See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms. OpenSSH can use either the [master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master) or the [nist](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/nist-branch) branch of liboqs for key exchange mechanisms, but the master branch is required for signature mechanisms. The master branch is recommended for normal uses of OpenSSH as included mechanisms follow a stricter set of requirements; the nist branch contains more algorithms and is better suited for experimentation.\n+## Overview\n \n-**open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable** contains a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange algorithms using liboqs for prototyping purposes, specifically adding key exchange methods that use hybrid (post-quantum + traditional elliptic curve) or post-quantum-only algorithms.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".  The OQS-master branch of open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable is currently based on **OpenSSH version 7.9** (Git tag V_7_9_P1).\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for more information.\n \n-More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n+**OQS-OpenSSH** is a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange and signature algorithms using liboqs for prototyping purposes.\n \n-Contents\n---------\n+Both liboqs and this fork are part of the **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project**, which aims to develop and prototype quantum-safe cryptography. More information about the project can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n \n-This branch ([OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master)) integrates post-quantum key exchange and authentication from liboqs in SSH 2 in OpenSSH v7.9 portable 1.\n+## Status\n \n-### Key exchange mechanisms\n+This fork is currently based on OpenSSH version **7.9** (Git tag V_7_9_P1), and is maintained for the purposes of prototyping and evaluating the use of quantum-safe cryptography in SSH. **It is at an experimental stage**, and has not received the same level of auditing and analysis that OpenSSH has received. See the [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security) section below for more information.\n \n-The following key exchange / key encapsulation methods from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n+**We do not recommend relying on this fork in a production environment or to protect any sensitive data.**\n \n-- `bike1-L1`, `bike1-L3`, `bike1-L5`\n-- `bike2-L1`, `bike2-L3`, `bike2-L3`\n-- `frodo-640-aes`, `frodo-976-aes`\n-- `newhope-512`, `newhope-1024`\n-- `sike-503`, `sike-751`\n-- `oqsdefault`\n-\n-In addition to the PQ-only key exchange methods, the following hybrid methods are supported combining a PQ scheme with ECDH using NIST's P384 curve (assuming the PQ schemes have been enabled in liboqs and that the `hybrid-kex` configuration option has been enabled; see below):\n-\n-- `ecdh-nistp384-<KEX>`, where <KEX> is any of the key exchange algorithms listed above.\n-\n-### Authentication mechanisms\n+liboqs is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind.

We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography. This fork provides the ability to use hybrid cryptography.\n \n-Limitations and security\n-------------------------\n+### Supported Algorithms\n \n-liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography.  Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.\n+#### Key Exchange\n \n-We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms.  liboqs does not intend to \"pick winners\", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.\n+The following quantum-safe algorithms from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n \n-We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project.

See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms. OpenSSH can use either the [master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master) or the [nist](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/nist-branch) branch of liboqs for key exchange mechanisms, but the master branch is required for signature mechanisms. The master branch is recommended for normal uses of OpenSSH as included mechanisms follow a stricter set of requirements; the nist branch contains more algorithms and is better suited for experimentation.\n+## Overview\n \n-**open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable** contains a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange algorithms using liboqs for prototyping purposes, specifically adding key exchange methods that use hybrid (post-quantum + traditional elliptic curve) or post-quantum-only algorithms.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".  The OQS-master branch of open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable is currently based on **OpenSSH version 7.9** (Git tag V_7_9_P1).\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for more information.\n \n-More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n+**OQS-OpenSSH** is a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange and signature algorithms using liboqs for prototyping purposes.\n \n-Contents\n---------\n+Both liboqs and this fork are part of the **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project**, which aims to develop and prototype quantum-safe cryptography. More information about the project can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n \n-This branch ([OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master)) integrates post-quantum key exchange and authentication from liboqs in SSH 2 in OpenSSH v7.9 portable 1.\n+## Status\n \n-### Key exchange mechanisms\n+This fork is currently based on OpenSSH version **7.9** (Git tag V_7_9_P1), and is maintained for the purposes of prototyping and evaluating the use of quantum-safe cryptography in SSH. **It is at an experimental stage**, and has not received the same level of auditing and analysis that OpenSSH has received. See the [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security) section below for more information.\n \n-The following key exchange / key encapsulation methods from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n+**We do not recommend relying on this fork in a production environment or to protect any sensitive data.**\n \n-- `bike1-L1`, `bike1-L3`, `bike1-L5`\n-- `bike2-L1`, `bike2-L3`, `bike2-L3`\n-- `frodo-640-aes`, `frodo-976-aes`\n-- `newhope-512`, `newhope-1024`\n-- `sike-503`, `sike-751`\n-- `oqsdefault`\n-\n-In addition to the PQ-only key exchange methods, the following hybrid methods are supported combining a PQ scheme with ECDH using NIST's P384 curve (assuming the PQ schemes have been enabled in liboqs and that the `hybrid-kex` configuration option has been enabled; see below):\n-\n-- `ecdh-nistp384-<KEX>`, where <KEX> is any of the key exchange algorithms listed above.\n-\n-### Authentication mechanisms\n+liboqs is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind.

We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography. This fork provides the ability to use hybrid cryptography.\n \n-Limitations and security\n-------------------------\n+### Supported Algorithms\n \n-liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography.

See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms. OpenSSH can use either the [master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master) or the [nist](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/nist-branch) branch of liboqs for key exchange mechanisms, but the master branch is required for signature mechanisms. The master branch is recommended for normal uses of OpenSSH as included mechanisms follow a stricter set of requirements; the nist branch contains more algorithms and is better suited for experimentation.\n+## Overview\n \n-**open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable** contains a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange algorithms using liboqs for prototyping purposes, specifically adding key exchange methods that use hybrid (post-quantum + traditional elliptic curve) or post-quantum-only algorithms.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".  The OQS-master branch of open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable is currently based on **OpenSSH version 7.9** (Git tag V_7_9_P1).\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for more information.\n \n-More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n+**OQS-OpenSSH** is a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange and signature algorithms using liboqs for prototyping purposes.\n \n-Contents\n---------\n+Both liboqs and this fork are part of the **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project**, which aims to develop and prototype quantum-safe cryptography. More information about the project can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n \n-This branch ([OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master)) integrates post-quantum key exchange and authentication from liboqs in SSH 2 in OpenSSH v7.9 portable 1.\n+## Status\n \n-### Key exchange mechanisms\n+This fork is currently based on OpenSSH version **7.9** (Git tag V_7_9_P1), and is maintained for the purposes of prototyping and evaluating the use of quantum-safe cryptography in SSH. **It is at an experimental stage**, and has not received the same level of auditing and analysis that OpenSSH has received. See the [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security) section below for more information.\n \n-The following key exchange / key encapsulation methods from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n+**We do not recommend relying on this fork in a production environment or to protect any sensitive data.**\n \n-- `bike1-L1`, `bike1-L3`, `bike1-L5`\n-- `bike2-L1`, `bike2-L3`, `bike2-L3`\n-- `frodo-640-aes`, `frodo-976-aes`\n-- `newhope-512`, `newhope-1024`\n-- `sike-503`, `sike-751`\n-- `oqsdefault`\n-\n-In addition to the PQ-only key exchange methods, the following hybrid methods are supported combining a PQ scheme with ECDH using NIST's P384 curve (assuming the PQ schemes have been enabled in liboqs and that the `hybrid-kex` configuration option has been enabled; see below):\n-\n-- `ecdh-nistp384-<KEX>`, where <KEX> is any of the key exchange algorithms listed above.\n-\n-### Authentication mechanisms\n+liboqs is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind.  See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/nist-branch/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.\n \n-The following signature methods from liboqs's master branch are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs and that the `pq-auth` configuration option has been enabled; see below):\n+This fork also contains an experimental (pre-draft) [IETF draft](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/blob/OQS-master/ietf_pre_draft_sike_bike_hybrid_kex.txt) for hybrid key exchange algorithms ECDH-SIKE and ECDH-BIKE. This document has **not** been submitted to IETF.\n \n-- `qteslai`, `qteslaiiispeed`, `qteslaiiisize`\n-- `picnicl1fs`\n-- `oqsdefault`\n+### Limitations and security\n+As research advances, the supported algorithms may see rapid changes in their security, and may even prove insecure against both classical and quantum computers.\n \n-In addition to the PQ-only signature methods, the following hybrid methods are supported combining a PQ scheme with either RSA3072 or ECDSA using NIST's P256 curve for L1 schemes, and with ECDSA using NIST's P384 curve for L3 schemes (assuming the PQ schemes have been enabled in liboqs and that the `hybrid-auth` configuration option has been enabled; see below):\n+We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms, and strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.\n \n-- `rsa3072-qteslai`, `p256-qteslai`, `p384-qteslaiiispeed`, `p384-qteslaiiisize`\n-- `rsa3072-picnicl1fs`, `p256-picnicl1fs`\n-- `rsa3072-oqsdefault`, `p256-oqsdefault`\n+While at the time of this writing there are no vulnerabilities known in any of the quantum-safe algorithms used in this fork, it is advisable to wait on deploying quantum-safe algorithms until further guidance is provided by the standards community, especially from the NIST standardization project.\n \n-The liboqs's nist branch uses a different signature API that hasn't yet been integrated.\n+We realize some parties may want to deploy quantum-safe cryptography prior to the conclusion of the standardization project.  We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography. This fork provides the ability to use hybrid cryptography.\n \n-Limitations and security\n-------------------------\n+### Supported Algorithms\n \n-liboqs is designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography.  Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.\n+#### Key Exchange\n \n-We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms.  liboqs does not intend to \"pick winners\", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.\n+The following quantum-safe algorithms from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n \n-We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project.
