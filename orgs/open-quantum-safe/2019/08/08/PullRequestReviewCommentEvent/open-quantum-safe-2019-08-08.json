Implementations on this branch must beet certain acceptance criteria.\n+- **Algorithmic requirements:**\n+\t- The algorithm must be submitted to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project, or posted as update to an existing algorithm, and must be present in the current round\n+\t- Algorithms whose security is considered effectively broken are not eligible for addition; see the Lifecycle section below for conditions on their removal.\n+\t- KEMs can be IND-CPA or IND-CCA-secure, at any NIST security level.\n+\t- Signature schemes can be EUF-CMA-secure, at any NIST security level.\n+- **Targets**:\n+\t- **Operating systems:** The code must build on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n+\t- **Architecture:** The code must build at least on x86 and x64.  Build targets are available for various processor-specific features.\n+- **Source code requirements:**\n+\t- **License:** Source code licensed under the MIT License, the BSD license, or in the public domain can be directly incorporated into the repository.  GPL code will not be included in the repository.\n+\t- **Code quality:** The source code must meet the following quality checks, some of which are enforced by our continuous integration system:\n+\t\t- Public API functions must be documented with appropriate Doxygen comments.\n+\t\t- Source code must be formatted in accordance with our formatting requirements (`make prettyprint`).\n+\t\t- All secrets in memory must be zero'ed out before being deallocated/released using our `OQS_MEM_*` functions.\n+\t\t- Exported symbols must be namespaced.\n+\t\t- We will periodically run static analysis other analysis tools to identify additional potential flaws.\n+\t- **Common function usage:** The source code should make use of liboqs' random number generator, AES implementation, and SHA-3 implementation, rather than its own implementation.\n+- **Maintenance**: We hope the contributor will intend to help update the implementation in liboqs as the algorithm evolves or as we make enhancements to the library.\n+The goals and acceptance criteria for new algorithms on liboqs master branch are stated in the README.md.  In particular, our goals are to include high quality implementations for which the contributor aims to help with ongoing maintenance.\n \n-liboqs nist-branch focuses on incorporating submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project. It takes a \"light touch\" approach to incorporation.\n+To discuss the contribution of a new algorithm to liboqs master branch, please contact [Douglas Stebila](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/about/contact/) or post an issue on GitHub for discussion.\n \n-Contributing new algorithms\n----------------------------\n+Additional information, including coding conventions, can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki).\n \n-The goals and acceptance criteria for new algorithms on liboqs master branch are stated in the README.md.  In particular, our goals are to include high quality implementations for which the contributor aims to help with ongoing maintenance.  \n+## Contributing other enhancements\n \n-To discuss contributing a new algorithm to liboqs master branch, please contact [Douglas Stebila](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/research/) or post an issue on GitHub for discussion.\n+Bug reports can be filed as issues on GitHub.  Please use the \"bug\" label and indicate which version of liboqs the issue relates to (by specifying the commit hash), and what platform was in use (CPU, operating system, compiler).\n \n-Additional information about contributing code, including coding conventions, can be found on our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki).\n+If you have some improvements to an algorithm, are interested in getting liboqs to build on a new platform, or want to explore integrating liboqs into a new application, feel free to open an issue or contribute a pull request.\n \n-Contributing enhancements\n--------------------------\n+## Lifecycle\n \n-Contributions to our existing library are gratefully welcomed.  If you find a bug in our code, have some improvements to an algorithm, are interested in getting liboqs to build on a new platform, or want to explore integrating liboqs into a new application, please feel free to contact us on GitHub via an issue or pull request.\n+**Release cycle:** We aim to make releases 2 to 3 months.  Plans for each individual release can be found on the [Github projects board](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/).  \n \n-Bug reports\n------------\n+**Versioning:** For approximately the period 2018-2019, we plan to label our releases with a variant of semantic versioning, using the notation *0.Y.Z*.  Semantic versioning allows that anything may change between *0.whatever* versions.  We intend to use *X.Y.Z* labelling as follows, for *X=0*.\n \n-Bug reports can be filed as issues on GitHub.  Please use the \"bug\" label.  Please indicate which branch of liboqs the issue relates to (master or nist-branch), and what platform was in use (CPU, operating system, compiler).\n+- *X=0* will be used for approximately the period 2018-2019.  Later in 2019, we will revisit whether we are ready to make a *1.0.0* release, and specify a new verisoning method at that time.\n+- *Y* will be incremented when backwards incompatible changes are introduced that either change the public API or change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm.  See explanation below.\n+- *Z* will be incremented when backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced.  \n \n-License\n--------\n+**Algorithm deprecation:** If an algorithm in master branch is found to be insecure or does not advance to the next round of the NIST competition, but is included in version $0.Y.Z$, it will be marked as deprecated using a compile time warning in version $0.(Y+1).Z'$ and removed in version $0.(Y+2).Z''$.\n \n-liboqs is licensed primarily under the MIT License.  Submissions to liboqs master branch must be under the MIT License, a compatible license, or in the public domain.  See README.md for details.\n+**Algorithm compatibility:** Unlike existing standardization cryptographic algorithms (SHA-2, SHA-3, PKCS\\#1v1.5, nistp256, ...), post-quantum algorithms are under active development, and the mathematical algorithm of a cryptographic scheme may change: a particular name (e.g., \"FrodoKEM-AES-640\") may refer to different mathematical algorithms over time.  liboqs may update implementations as algorithms evolve.  During the $0.Y.Z$ phase of liboqs, versions $0.Y.Z$ and version $0.(Y+1).Z'$ may not be interoperable.  liboqs-reliant applications can check the `alg_version` member of the `OQS_KEM` data structure for each algorithm to obtain an identifier of the algorithm version used in a particular implementation; implementations returning the same `alg_version` for an algorithm will be interoperable.\n+\n+**API stability:** The public API of liboqs master branch is currently considered to be the functions and macros in `oqs/common.h`, `oqs/oqsconfig.h`, `oqs/kem.h`, `oqs/rand.h`, `oqs/sig.h`, and includes all functions marked with `OQS_API`.  During the $0.Y.Z$ phase of liboqs, incompatible changes to the public API will lead to incrementing $Y$.\n+\n+## License\n+\n+liboqs is licensed primarily under the MIT License.

See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.\n-\n-Acceptance criteria for master branch\n--------------------------------------\n-\n-New submissions to master branch must meet the following acceptance criteria:\n+liboqs is part of the **Open Quantum Safe (OQS)** project led by [Douglas Stebila](https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/research/) and [Michele Mosca](http://faculty.iqc.uwaterloo.ca/mmosca/), which aims to develop and integrate into applications quantum-safe cryptography to facilitate deployment and testing. In particular, OQS provides prototype integrations of liboqs into TLS and SSH, through [OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl) and [OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable).\n \n-- **Algorithmic requirements:**\n-\t- The algorithm must be submitted to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project, or posted as update to an existing algorithm, and must be present in the current round\n-\t- Algorithms whose security is considered effectively broken are not eligible for addition; see the Lifecycle section below for conditions on their removal.\n-\t- KEMs can be IND-CPA or IND-CCA-secure, at any NIST security level.\n-\t- Signature schemes can be EUF-CMA-secure, at any NIST security level.\n-- **Targets**:\n-\t- **Operating systems:** The code must build on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n-\t- **Architecture:** The code must build at least on x86 and x64.  Build targets are available for various processor-specific features.\n-- **Source code requirements:**\n-\t- **License:** Source code licensed under the MIT License, the BSD license, or in the public domain can be directly incorporated into the repository.  GPL code will not be included in the repository.\n-\t- **Code quality:** The source code must meet the following quality checks, some of which are enforced by our continuous integration system:\n-\t\t- Public API functions must be documented with appropriate Doxygen comments.\n-\t\t- Source code must be formatted in accordance with our formatting requirements (`make prettyprint`).\n-\t\t- All secrets in memory must be zero'ed out before being deallocated/released using our `OQS_MEM_*` functions.\n-\t\t- Exported symbols must be namespaced.\n-\t\t- We will periodically run static analysis other analysis tools to identify additional potential flaws.\n-\t- **Common function usage:** The source code should make use of liboqs' random number generator, AES implementation, and SHA-3 implementation, rather than its own implementation.\n-- **Maintenance**: We hope the contributor will intend to help update the implementation in liboqs as the algorithm evolves or as we make enhancements to the library.\n+More information on OQS can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/) and in the [associated](https://openquantumsafe.org/papers/SAC-SteMos16.pdf) [whitepapers](https://openquantumsafe.org/papers/NISTPQC-CroPaqSte19.pdf).\n \n-Algorithms may be removed from liboqs master branch if they no longer meet the acceptance criteria, see the lifecycle section below.\n+## Status\n \n-Contributing\n-------------\n+liboqs is intended to facilitate the evaluation of quantum-safe cryptography in real world contexts. As research advances, the supported algorithms may see rapid changes in their security, and may even prove insecure against both classical and quantum computers.\n \n-Contributions that meet the acceptance criteria above are gratefully welcomed.  See <a href=\"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> for details on contributing an implementation.\n+liboqs does not intend to \"pick winners\": algorithm support is informed by the NIST [Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Standardization) project. We strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of ths effort when deploying post-quantum cryptography.\n \n-Lifecycle for master branch\n----------------------------\n+We realize some parties may want to deploy quantum-safe cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project.  We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.\n \n-**Release cycle:** We aim to make releases of liboqs master branch every 2 to 3 months.  Plans for each individual release can be found on our [Github projects board](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/).  \n+## Quickstart\n \n-**Versioning:** For approximately the period 2018-2019, we plan to label our releases with a variant of semantic versioning, using the notation *0.Y.Z*.  Semantic versioning allows that anything may change between *0.whatever* versions.  We intend to use *X.Y.Z* labelling as follows, for *X=0*.\n+### Ubuntu/macOS\n \n-- *X=0* will be used for approximately the period 2018-2019.  Later in 2019, we will revisit whether we are ready to make a *1.0.0* release, and specify a new verisoning method at that time.\n-- *Y* will be incremented when backwards incompatible changes are introduced that either change the public API or change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm.  See explanation below.\n-- *Z* will be incremented when backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced.  \n+0. Install dependencies:\n \n-**Algorithm deprecation:** If an algorithm in master branch is found to be insecure or does not advance to the next round of the NIST competition, but is included in version $0.Y.Z$, it will be marked as deprecated using a compile time warning in version $0.(Y+1).Z'$ and removed in version $0.(Y+2).Z''$.\n+On
