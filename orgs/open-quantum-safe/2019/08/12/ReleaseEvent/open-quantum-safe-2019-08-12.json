More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OpenSSL 1.0.2**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.2 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.0.2; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **OpenSSH 7.7 portable 1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into SSH in our fork of OpenSSH 7.7; see the [OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master) branch of our OpenSSH fork's repository.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/thales-e-security/goliboqs\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis release of liboqs was released on TODO.  Its release page on GitHub is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/master-0.2.0.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.1.0 release of liboqs \"master branch\".  \r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- Update FrodoKEM, NewHope, and SIDH/SIKE to NIST Round 2 submissions\r\n- Add Kyber, NTRU, and Saber NIST Round 2 submissions\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Update Picnic to NIST Round 2 submissions\r\n- Add Dilithium, MQDSS, Rainbow, and SPHINCS+ NIST Round 2 submissions\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Add support for cross-compilation on ARM\r\n- Add more extensive continuous integration testing\r\n- Use OpenSSL for AES, SHA-2, and SHA-3 where available\r\n- Add functions for runtime detection of whether KEM and signature scheme algorithms are enabled\r\n\r\nPrevious releases of liboqs differentiated between \"master branch\" and \"nist-branch\", with nist-branch supporting more algorithms.  As of this release, nist-branch will no longer be developed or released, and all future releases are planned to be based on master branch.\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nReleases of liboqs master branch will be made every 2 to 3 months.  Details about the algorithm lifecycle of master branch can be found at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Contributing-Guide.  Plans for the next release can be found online at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/11\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-08-12T17:52:24Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
