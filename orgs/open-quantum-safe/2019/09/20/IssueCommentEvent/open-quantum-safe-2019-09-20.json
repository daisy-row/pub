These sizes are to be set when an instance of the signature algorithm is created via a call to `OQS_new`, and are then used to allocate sufficient memory for keys before calling the algorithm's keygen method. However, some QS signature schemes have varying key sizes (e.g. NIST candidate [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/), which features optional compression for private keys).\r\n\r\nConsidering this, it could be better to let the algorithm's keygen method modify the key size fields appropriately. This would also require adding a `max_key_len` field to `OQS_SIG` so as to enable the caller to allocate memory before the keygen method is called."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/533617051","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/297#issuecomment-533617051","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/297","id":533617051,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzYxNzA1MQ==","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-20T16:09:35Z","updated_at":"2019-09-20T16:09:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this as the NIST branch is being deprecated."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-09-20T16:09:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
