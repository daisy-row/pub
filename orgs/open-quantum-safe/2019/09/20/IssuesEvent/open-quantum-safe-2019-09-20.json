Through some experimentation, I've noticed that for the OQS algorithms, an oqs_pkey_ctrl() function that handles the ASN1_PKEY_CTRL_PKCS7_SIGN operation isn't defined in oqs_meth.c as has been done for classical algorithms such as in rsa_ameth.c or ec_ameth.c. I blindly wrote a crude  implementation of that function to see what else fails with generating a PKCS7 signature with an quantum safe signature algorithm and I hit a lot of issues with OpenSSL's PKCS7 code not handling a NULL digest associated with OQS private keys. \r\n\r\nCould someone provide some background on why PKCS7 support with OQS along wasn't done (totally understand if it wasn't a priority) as it seems a lot of the core ASN1 calls were implemented in oqs_meth.c or if there is some gating technical reason that would make this work a challenge?

These sizes are to be set when an instance of the signature algorithm is created via a call to `OQS_new`, and are then used to allocate sufficient memory for keys before calling the algorithm's keygen method. However, some QS signature schemes have varying key sizes (e.g. NIST candidate [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/), which features optional compression for private keys).\r\n\r\nConsidering this, it could be better to let the algorithm's keygen method modify the key size fields appropriately. This would also require adding a `max_key_len` field to `OQS_SIG` so as to enable the caller to allocate memory before the keygen method is called."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-09-20T16:09:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
