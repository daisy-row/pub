Up to the integration of templating code, the code points (used in TLS to specify the selected \"curve\") were assigned manually and care was taken to keep previously defined values the same, to ensure that client/server remained interoperable between versions or implementations (e.g., openssl and boringssl). Templating simplifies the integration of new algs, but overwrites previous code point values. This means that, in the future, any changes of the OQS supported list of algs will result in different code point values.\r\n\r\nWe should design a mechanism to assign specific code points to an algorithm, both if this is specified in a standard, or to preserve interop between releases. We support this already for signature OIDs.\r\n\r\nIf we break compatibility in this release, we should document that and bump the release version number accordingly."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/532409925","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/116#issuecomment-532409925","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/116","id":532409925,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjQwOTkyNQ==","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-17T21:30:01Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T21:30:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The signature NIDs are assigned automatically in that the order in which the signature algorithms are specified in `crypto/objects/objects.txt` determines the NID assigned in `include/openssl/obj_mac.h`. \r\n\r\nThis means interoperability is preserved if entries are only appended to the file.
