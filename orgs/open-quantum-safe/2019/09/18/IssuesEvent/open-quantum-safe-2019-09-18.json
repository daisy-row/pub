I'm considering doing a little benchmark of the post quantum ciphers in a openssl playground (mainly kex & signature algorithms). I've tested the command line server that comes with the openssl server and generated a self signed certificate with the pq signature of choice. I could connect to this server via the  openssl s_client tool, which lets you specify with the -curves parameter the <KEX> algorithm. This option is not available with the s_time command, very handy when benchmarking TLS connections. How do I specifically force a KEX algorithm in the test server/client connection with s_time. Are there any workarounds that you might know?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-09-18T09:46:58Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
