A few things:\r\n\r\n- Yes, the project targets .net core 1.1; not the current 2.0 or in-preview 3.0. Moving to a newer framework removes support to older platforms; although complicates install on new machines. I'll add a note in the readme. I suggest we leave this as is, and revisit prior to our v1.0 to see which platform is preferred (based on user feedback)\r\n- Trying to build on the command line is error-prone (if a package is missing). That's what's described in the readme, for brevity reasons, but opening the solutions (both for OQS and the wrapper) in Visual Studio provides helpful messages to resolve issue (e.g., re-target the Windows SDK to build OQS, and a bunch of missing packages were retrieved automatically for the wrapper).\r\n- I didn't get the error you last saw, wrt the missing QOS function. This is a fairly new function in OQS; did you download a fresh copy of the library from the master branch?\r\n- Can we change the github project name? It might be better to call this liboqs-dotnet given the generalized platform that .net is\r\n- Speaking of, .net also works on linux and macOS, so it would be interesting to try the project there too. I'm not sure how the DllImport would work on these platforms howerver...
