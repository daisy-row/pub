_load_shared_obj() is called during import, which sets up the liboqs var. Loading liboqs is coupled to import time, which is a bit problematic\r\n  - can't monkeypatch _load_shared_obj() until after the wrapper has been imported\r\n  - some parts of the code can't be tested

What about a common OO API for all the wrappers?\r\n* Douglas: does the OQS_[KEM|SIG] represent an instance of an alg, or a general mechanism?\r\n* Douglas: methods, secret_key as member vs method arg\r\n* Douglas: include length checks in some of the functions\r\n* Douglas: do KAT tests somewhere?\r\n* Wrapper doesn't support nist-branch Sig interface at present\r\n* Should vars in the 'details' dict be moved into the class, and then replace 'details' with a Py getter property?\r\n* Ben: defer when the SO is loaded for testing?\r\n  - _load_shared_obj() is called during import, which sets up the liboqs var. Loading liboqs is coupled to import time, which is a bit problematic\r\n  - can't monkeypatch _load_shared_obj() until after the wrapper has been imported\r\n  - some parts of the code can't be tested
