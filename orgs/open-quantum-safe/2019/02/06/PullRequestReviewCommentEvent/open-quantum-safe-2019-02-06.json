per the weekly meeting, here is a PR for discussion of the code changes pushed yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe tasks & discussion points include:\r\n* Update Py method names to match C KEM & Sig structs\r\n* Douglas: does the OQS_[KEM|SIG] represent an instance of an alg, or a general mechanism?\r\n* Douglas: methods, secret_key as member vs method arg\r\n* Douglas: include length checks in some of the functions\r\n* Douglas: do KAT tests somewhere?\r\n* Wrapper doesn't support nist-branch Sig interface at present\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-06T19:26:55Z","updated_at":"2019-02-06T21:47:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5c37d1b37b70d4709b59802d576185c4cfe4ed3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1167238766,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTY3MjM4NzY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true},{"id":1167238770,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTY3MjM4Nzcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true},{"id":1168138078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTY4MTM4MDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/labels/refactor","name":"refactor","color":"d4c5f9","default":false}],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/pulls/8/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/pulls/8/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/issues/8/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/statuses/bf12f1053433a71c9e63d857710e3578e1625c83","head":{"label":"open-quantum-safe:refactor-class-bd","ref":"refactor-class-bd","sha":"bf12f1053433a71c9e63d857710e3578e1625c83","user":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":162497174,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjI0OTcxNzQ=","name":"liboqs-python","full_name":"open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python","description":"[work
