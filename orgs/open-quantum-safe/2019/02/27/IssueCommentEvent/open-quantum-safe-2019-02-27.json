NTRU LPRime is a round two KEM candidate in the NIST competition.\r\n\r\nAssuming I can get a clear answer from the authors (Bernstein et al) on the license that applies to their reference implementations, would you be interested in such a contribution? I'm thinking this would be a drop-in of the reference implementation, adjusted as necessary to meet the requirements for your master branch.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this is our desire to use NTRU LPRime (in hybrid mode) with TLS for some research work we are doing. Step one would be contributing NTRU LPRime to liboqs. Step two would be making contributions to your OpenSSL fork.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing NTRU LPRime rather than Streamlined NTRU Prime, since the metrics on their home page suggest NTRU LPRime offers faster performance for a key gen, followed by encaps and decaps.

subdirectories from prettyprint\r\n- Add shims that translate PQClean's SHA-3 / randombytes provider to liboqs' functions\r\n\r\nThen it's a matter of wiring the particular implementation into the

I looked at the diff and tried the PR on both Linux and Windows; works well. I compared the copied code from the PQClean project; in the upstream project methods are prepended with `PQCLEAN_KYBER768_CLEAN_`, but in OQS `PQCLEAN_KYBER768_` is used (missing the `CLEAN_` suffix); why is that? A clean code diff would make it easier to verify proper import.\r\n\r\nThey changed their prefixing from `PQCLEAN_KYBER768_` to `PQCLEAN_KYBER768_CLEAN_` earlier today, after I'd already copied the code.  :(  The intention would be for OQS to use exactly the prefixing from PQClean, and I would use the new names in the next sync.
