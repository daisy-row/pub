It is slightly trickier than just using the KATs from the NIST submission ZIPs because the format is different.  The NIST API has a \"signed-message\" format, where the sign algorithm outputs a byte array containing both the message and the signature, in whatever order/encoding the submitters wanted.  In liboqs, we use a \"detached signature\" format, where the sign algorithm outputs a byte array containing just the signature.  So we wouldn't exactly match the original KATs.  The solutions I can think of are either to make a wrapper around each of our signature schemes that reconstructs the signed-message format from the detached signature format (which may be different for each scheme, since as far as I know NIST did not specify a particular signed-message format); or deconstruct each scheme's KAT to detach the signature from the signed message format."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-07-08T18:17:15Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
