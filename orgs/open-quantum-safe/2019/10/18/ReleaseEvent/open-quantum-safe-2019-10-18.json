More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.\r\n\r\n**liboqs-go** is an open source Go wrapper for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs-go can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis pre-release of liboqs-go was released on October 18, 2019.  Its pre-release page on GitHub is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/releases/tag/0.1.0.\r\n\r\nThis is the first public pre-release of liboqs-go. It is still work in progress and not yet recommended for production use.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor a list of changes see [CHANGES.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-18T19:34:14Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
