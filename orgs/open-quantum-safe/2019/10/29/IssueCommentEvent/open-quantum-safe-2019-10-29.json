Everything seems to work.\r\n\r\nI do get OpenSSL fork to compile with liboqs and a local installation (/usr/local) of OpenSSL.  The issue I get is when I try to compile code using standard OpenSSL with OpenSSL fork it complains that \"oqs/oqs.h\" couldn't be found.  Indeed \"oqs/oqs.h\" is not installed when I issue a \"make install\" inside the OpenSSL fork directory.\r\n\r\nHere's my build process:\r\n================\r\ncd /root/build/openssl/openssl-OpenSSL_1_1_1d && make clean ; ./Configure shared linux-x86_64 -lm --prefix=\"/usr/local/openssl-1.1.1d\" && make -j 4 && make install\r\ncd /root/build/liboqs/liboqs-0.2.0/ && autoreconf -i\r\ncd /root/build/liboqs/liboqs-0.2.0/ && make clean ; ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=\"/root/build/openssloqs/openssl-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2019-10//oqs\" --with-openssl=\"/usr/local/openssl-1.1.1d\" \"--disable-kem-bike\" && make -j 4 && make install\r\ncd /root/build/openssloqs/openssl-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2019-10/ && make clean ; ./Configure --prefix=\"/usr/local/1.1.1d-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable_snapshot_2019-10-0.2.0\" shared linux-x86_64 -lm && make -j 4 && make install\r\n\r\nNow, when I make code that uses standard OpenSSL I get this error (evp.h)\r\n\r\nError:\r\n=====\r\n/tmp/openssldir/include/openssl/evp.h:18:11: fatal error: oqs/oqs.h: No such file or directory\r\n # include <oqs/oqs.h>\r\n           ^~~~~~~~~~~\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake: *** [<builtin>: OutboundTransferMgr.o] Error 1\r\n[ CHROOT ] bash-4.2$>\r\n\r\n==> How should I use the OpenSSL fork when building software that uses OpenSSL?\r\n\r\nI have added \"-I/root/build/openssloqs/openssl-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2019-10/oqs/include\" to the Makefile so that \"oqs/oqs.h\" could resolve but I get other strange errors following this.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work here.  Let me know how I should build OpenSSL enabled software with OpenSSL/OQS\r\n\r\n(Note:  I'm trying to link first with OpenSSL fork without doing any significant modifications to the source base.  Once I get to compile I'll see if I can add new OQS features in the code later)\r\n\r\nSylvain!"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/547490725","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/568#issuecomment-547490725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/568","id":547490725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzQ5MDcyNQ==","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T15:49:26Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T15:49:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Could you move the issue to [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues)?"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-10-29T15:49:26Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Everything seems to work.\r\n\r\nI do get OpenSSL fork to compile with liboqs and a local installation (/usr/local) of OpenSSL.  The issue I get is when I try to compile code using standard OpenSSL with OpenSSL fork it complains that \"oqs/oqs.h\" couldn't be found.  Indeed \"oqs/oqs.h\" is not installed when I issue a \"make install\" inside the OpenSSL fork directory.\r\n\r\nHere's my build process:\r\n================\r\ncd /root/build/openssl/openssl-OpenSSL_1_1_1d && make clean ; ./Configure shared linux-x86_64 -lm --prefix=\"/usr/local/openssl-1.1.1d\" && make -j 4 && make install\r\ncd /root/build/liboqs/liboqs-0.2.0/ && autoreconf -i\r\ncd /root/build/liboqs/liboqs-0.2.0/ && make clean ; ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=\"/root/build/openssloqs/openssl-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2019-10//oqs\" --with-openssl=\"/usr/local/openssl-1.1.1d\" \"--disable-kem-bike\" && make -j 4 && make install\r\ncd /root/build/openssloqs/openssl-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2019-10/ && make clean ; ./Configure --prefix=\"/usr/local/1.1.1d-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable_snapshot_2019-10-0.2.0\" shared linux-x86_64 -lm && make -j 4 && make install\r\n\r\nNow, when I make code that uses standard OpenSSL I get this error (evp.h)\r\n\r\nError:\r\n=====\r\n/tmp/openssldir/include/openssl/evp.h:18:11: fatal error: oqs/oqs.h: No such file or directory\r\n # include <oqs/oqs.h>\r\n           ^~~~~~~~~~~\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\nmake: *** [<builtin>: OutboundTransferMgr.o] Error 1\r\n[ CHROOT ] bash-4.2$>\r\n\r\n==> How should I use the OpenSSL fork when building software that uses OpenSSL?\r\n\r\nI have added \"-I/root/build/openssloqs/openssl-OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2019-10/oqs/include\" to the Makefile so that \"oqs/oqs.h\" could resolve but I get other strange errors following this.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work here.  Let me know how I should build OpenSSL enabled software with OpenSSL/OQS\r\n\r\n(Note:  I'm trying to link first with OpenSSL fork without doing any significant modifications to the source base.  Once I get to compile I'll see if I can add new OQS features in the code later)\r\n\r\nSylvain!"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/547559601","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/568#issuecomment-547559601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/568","id":547559601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzU1OTYwMQ==","user":{"login":"syrtap","id":9990094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTAwOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9990094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap","html_url":"https://github.com/syrtap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syrtap/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-29T18:13:31Z","updated_at":"2019-10-29T18:13:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've looked and I can't move it since I don't have the permissions.
