More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.\r\n\r\n**liboqs-go** is an open source Go wrapper for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs-go can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis release of liboqs-go was released on October 24, 2019.
