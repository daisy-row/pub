As Google's product portfolio became more complex,\n-more copies of OpenSSL sprung up and the effort involved in maintaining all\n-these patches in multiple places was growing steadily.\n-\n-Currently BoringSSL is the SSL library in Chrome/Chromium, Android (but it's\n-not part of the NDK) and a number of other apps/programs.\n-\n-Project links:\n-\n-  * [API documentation](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-boringssl-docs/headers.html)\n-  * [Bug tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/boringssl/issues/list)\n-  * [CI](https://ci.chromium.org/p/boringssl/g/main/console)\n-  * [Code review](https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com)\n-\n-There are other files in this directory which might be helpful:\n-\n-  * [PORTING.md](/PORTING.md): how to port OpenSSL-using code to BoringSSL.\n-  * [BUILDING.md](/BUILDING.md): how to build BoringSSL\n-  * [INCORPORATING.md](/INCORPORATING.md): how to incorporate BoringSSL into a project.\n-  * [API-CONVENTIONS.md](/API-CONVENTIONS.md): general API conventions for BoringSSL consumers and developers.\n-  * [STYLE.md](/STYLE.md): rules and guidelines for coding style.\n-  * include/openssl: public headers with API documentation in comments.

([View the original README](README).)\n+\n+OQS-BoringSSL is a fork of BoringSSL that adds quantum-safe key exchange and authentication algorithms using [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) for prototyping and evaluation purposes. This fork is not endorsed by the BoringSSL project or Google.\n+\n+- [Overview](#overview)\n+- [Status](#status)\n+  * [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security)\n+  * [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms)\n+- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n+  * [Building](#building)\n+    * [Linux](#linux)\n+  * [Running](#running)\n+- [Team](#team)\n+- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\n+\n+## Overview\n+\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for more information.\n+\n+**OQS-BoringSSL** is a fork that integrates liboqs into BoringSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-safe cryptography in the TLS 1.3 protocol. (For TLS 1.2, see the [OQS-OpenSSL\\_1\\_0\\_2-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable) branch.)\n+\n+Both liboqs and this fork are part of the **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project**, which aims to develop and prototype quantum-safe cryptography. More information about the project can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n+\n+## Status\n+\n+This fork is built on top of [commit do41f11](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/commit/d041f11134951ea34c549032d20d041112697e4c), and adds the following:\n+\n+- quantum-safe key exchange in TLS 1.3\n+- hybrid (quantum-safe + elliptic curve) key exchange in TLS 1.3\n+\n+**This fork is at an experimental stage**. The BoringSSL project also does not guarantee API or ABI stability. See the [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security) section below for more information.\n+\n+**We do not recommend relying on this fork in a production environment or to protect any sensitive data.**\n+\n+liboqs and this integration are provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind.  See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.\n+\n+### Limitations and security\n+As research advances, the supported algorithms may see rapid changes in their security, and may even prove insecure against both classical and quantum computers.\n+\n+We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms, and strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying quantum-safe cryptography.\n+\n+While at the time of this writing there are no vulnerabilities known in any of the quantum-safe algorithms used in this fork, it is advisable to wait on deploying quantum-safe algorithms until further guidance is provided by the standards community, especially from the NIST standardization project.\n+\n+We realize some parties may want to deploy quantum-safe cryptography prior to the conclusion of the standardization project.  We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography. This fork provides the ability to use hybrid cryptography.\n+\n+Proofs of TLS such as [[JKSS12]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/219) and [[KPW13]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/339) require a key exchange mechanism that has a form of active security, either in the form of the PRF-ODH assumption, or an IND-CCA KEM.\n+Some of the KEMs provided in liboqs do provide IND-CCA security; others do not ([these datasheets](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master/docs/algorithms) specify which provide what security), in which case existing proofs of security of TLS against active attackers do not apply.\n+\n+### Supported Algorithms\n+\n+If an algorithm is provided by liboqs but is not listed below, it can still be used in the fork through [either one of two ways](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/wiki/Using-liboqs-algorithms-that-are-not-in-the-forks).\n+\n+#### Key Exchange\n+\n+The following quantum-safe algorithms from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n+\n+- `kemdefault` (see [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/wiki/Using-liboqs-algorithms-that-are-not-in-the-forks#oqsdefault) for what this denotes)\n+\n+The following hybrid algorithms are supported only for L1 schemes; they combine an L1 quantum-safe algorithm listed above with ECDH that uses NIST's P256 curve:\n+- `p256_<KEX>`, where ``<KEX>`` is any one of the L1 algorithms listed above.\n+\n+## Quickstart\n+\n+The steps below have been confirmed to work on Ubuntu 19.10 (gcc-8.3.0).\n+\n+### Building\n+\n+#### Linux\n+\n+#### Step 0: Get pre-requisites\n+\n+On **Ubuntu**, you need to install the following packages:\n+\n+\tsudo apt install autoconf automake cmake gcc golang-go libtool libssl-dev make ninja unzip xsltproc\n+\n+Then, get source code of this fork (`<BORINGSSL_DIR>` is a directory of your choosing):\n+\n+\tgit clone --branch master https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.git <BORINGSSL_DIR>\n+\n+#### Step 1: Build and install liboqs\n+\n+The following instructions will download and build liboqs, then install it into a subdirectory inside the OpenSSL folder.\n+\n+\tgit clone --branch master https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git\n+\tcd liboqs\n+\tautoreconf -i\n+\t./configure --prefix=<BORINGSSL_DIR>/oqs --without-openssl --enable-shared=no\n+\tmake -j\n+\tmake install\n+\n+#### Step 2: Build the fork\n+\n+Now we follow the standard instructions for building BoringSSL. Navigate to `<BORINGSSL_DIR>`, and:\n+\n+on **Ubuntu**, run:\n+\n+\tmkdir build\n+\tcd build\n+\tcmake -GNinja ..\n+\tninja\n+\n+The fork can also be built with shared libraries, to do so, run `cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES=ON -GNinja ..`.\n+\n+To execute the white-box and black-box tests, run `ninja run_tests` from the `build` directory.\n+\n+### Running\n+\n+#### TLS demo\n+\n+BoringSSL contains a basic TLS server (`s_server`) and TLS client (`s_client`) which can be used to demonstrate and test TLS connections.\n+\n+To run a basic TLS server with all libOQS ciphersuites enabled, from the `build` directory, run:\n+\n+\ttool/bssl s_server -accept 4433 -loop\n+\n+In another terminal window, you can run a TLS client requesting one of the supported ciphersuites (`<KEX>` = one of the quantum-safe or hybrid key exchange algorithms listed in the [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above):\n+\n+\ttool/bssl s_client -curves oqs_<KEX> -connect localhost:4433\n+","path":"README.md","position":null,"original_position":163,"commit_id":"99dc33a674169fc6cf05434b659ebc6b3666aabe","original_commit_id":"04c467f9788a9dde3a71144423a6ab4bc563e2c8","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Looks like the client and server can be specified with or without the `s_` prefix, and both options lead to the same functionality. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I removed the prefix anyway since I think `client` and `server` read a bit better than `s_client` and `s_server`.","created_at":"2019-10-07T15:46:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-07T15:46:46Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/1#discussion_r332095784","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pulls/1","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pulls/comments/332095784"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/1#discussion_r332095784"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pulls/1"}},"in_reply_to_id":331694389},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pulls/1","id":314227999,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzE0MjI3OTk5","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/1","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/1.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/1.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/1","number":1,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Added basic support for using liboqs kexs.","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"1) Judging by [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/statem/extensions_srvr.c#L1884) and [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/statem/extensions_clnt.c#L667), it would seem the key share message format in this PR is the same as in OpenSSL 1.1.1\r\n\r\n2) I've added the templating delimiters, the actual code will come in another PR.\r\n\r\n3) I'll also add the `oqs_test`-style integration tests in another PR; we could perhaps just augment the `go` black-box tests as opposed to adding a separate test-suite altogether.
