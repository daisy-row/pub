Options include:\r\n  - Slower: build liboqs (master & nist-branch) in travis, link to SO & run (~5 mins per container?)\r\n  - Middle: Provide pre-built binaries to download (~2.7mb on linux). Store where? Who updates them?\r\n  - Fast: redo tests with unittest.mock to replace ctypes interface. This is fast for unittests at the expense of connecting to the SO. Use example py script for that?\r\n\r\nOptional/nice to haves\r\n* Run test code coverage checker\r\n* Run any style check / static analysis tools?\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2019-01-29T18:10:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
