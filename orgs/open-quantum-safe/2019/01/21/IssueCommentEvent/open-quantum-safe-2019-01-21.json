Since the openssl project already has it's own code, it would be good split the script in subcomponents, for example: build-liboqs-master, build-liboqs-nist, build-openssl-1.0.2, build-openssl-1.1.1, run-openssl-1.0.2-tests, and run-openssl-1.1.1-tests. This way the openssl travis test could skip the build-openssl-* subscripts, and reuse the code to build liboqs and run the openssl tests.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/testing/issues/comments/456102720","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/testing/issues/1#issuecomment-456102720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/testing/issues/1","id":456102720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NjEwMjcyMA==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-21T15:00:45Z","updated_at":"2019-01-21T15:00:45Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not just to replicate the function oriented layout, but also allow the user to run a subset of the tests.
