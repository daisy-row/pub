Why? How can this happen given this is generated code? Or did you manually create this PR instead of running `oqs-template/generate.py`? In any case, please bring README.md and code in sync. The second question is more mundane/not asking for a change: Why this work on an \"old\" version of oqs-openssh?\r\n\r\nThe only change I made manually is the change to `oqs-template/generate.yml`. All the other changes are the result of running `oqs-template/generate.py`. I don't know why that line about DILITHIUM got removed from the README, but it was done by the script.\r\n\r\nAs for why to do this: This is in furtherance of my OQS-enabled version of libssh, which currently interoperates with the 7.9 version of OpenSSH (because the v8 fork didn't exist when I started that work). Douglas requested an update to the latest liboqs. After talking with Christian, the idea is to update both OQS-v7.9 and libssh to use liboqs 0.7.1 and get that out there, since that work is basically done, and then take updating libssh to work with OQS-OpenSSH v8 as a longer-term work item.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1011280466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-12T17:23:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
