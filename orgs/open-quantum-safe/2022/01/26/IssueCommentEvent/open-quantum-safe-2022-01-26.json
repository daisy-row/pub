Does anyone have any insight or thoughts into this?\r\n\r\nNope :-( Personally I wouldn't want to \"second guess\" Apple's choice of ARM abis, though. Thus I'd favour a very specific fix for an ABI version we know fits their current CPUs. If they move to another ARM version this might break again -- or they'll contribute to `gcc` for this madness to not happen again: `liboqs` can't be the only code base fighting with this (?)
