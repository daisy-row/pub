I'm not a coder myself, thou i'd really love to see a \"OQS-Wireguard\" fork, if not too much work? (Don't wanna use M$ 'PQ-VPN' - lack of trust, open-source or not.)\r\n\r\nThere's been some research on adding post-quantum algorithms to Wireguard, see https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/379.pdf.  Since that's already underway, we don't have plans to specifically connect OQS with Wireguard in this project.\r\n\r\n> Another OT-q; which one is the safest (toughest) of the liboqs algo's & which one is the speediest? Read somewhere 'Picnic'-algo is fast & secure against quantum.\r\n\r\nThere's no simple answer to that.  I suggest waiting for the forthcoming selections by NIST to help narrow things down.\r\n\r\n> Why i ask is because running a VPS with a private VPN on Debian, so suggestions is very welcome. Also, could you describe what to do to encrypt filesystem w/ the pq-ciphers?\r\n\r\nFilesystem encryption generally uses symmetric, rather than public key, algorithms.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1024666814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-28T21:45:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
