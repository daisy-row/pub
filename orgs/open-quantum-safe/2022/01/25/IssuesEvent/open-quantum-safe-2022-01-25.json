The MQTT client APIs that use OpenSSL (Paho, mosquitto) only allow to specified the ciphers to use (e.g., ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA), but give no option for _groups_ or _curves_, used in the example _opnessl s_client_ given, and in other integrations (Chromium). Any suggestions of what can I do?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/60/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/60/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-25T20:08:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
