into this a bit, it looks like gcc-11 thinks that the m1 doesn't have crypto extension support (when it indeed does). This is likely because apple is failing to advertise them, or is advertising them in a non-standard way. (We have to look for them indirectly in our own scripts, even when using appleclang)\r\n\r\nIn order to tell gcc-11 \"no, trust me it's there, insert those instructions\", I need to specify an arm version and enable the crypto extensions.\r\n\r\nOne option to fix this is to specify the arm abi version and compiling for that version. The m1 series chips are version 8.5-A, however we would likely want to use something like 8.1 to support more of their hardware? The minimum would be 8.0-A, which supports A7 and newer chips. I'm not sure how using an older abi version would effect compilation and the gcc's instruction choices. Does anyone have any insight or thoughts into this?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1021609876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-25T21:08:08Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
