More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.\r\n\r\n**OQS-libssh** is an integration of quantum-resistant algorithm from liboqs into (a fork of) libssh.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is the 2022-01 snapshot release of OQS-libssh, released on January 24, 2022. This release is intended to be used with [liboqs version 0.7.1](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.7.1) and interoperates with OQS-OpenSSH v7.9 (as of commit [f41bbe652c522db1bec388f82db369e4e5f0f405](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/tree/f41bbe652c522db1bec388f82db369e4e5f0f405)).\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the first snapshot release of the OQS fork of libssh. It is based on the libssh 0.10 development branch master as of commit [76b7e0e](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/libssh/commit/76b7e0e9b54bed74f3d9be75583e56960405847d).\r\n","short_description_html":"<h1>OQS-libssh snapshot 2022-01</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
