So it looks like this is indeed a pre-existing issue.\r\n\r\nThanks. I'd be inclined to merge this PR as is with the Picnic gcc M1 KATs failing, and create a separate issue for resolving that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1016748561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-19T18:27:21Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
