being familiar with the concepts of [Matrix](https://www.matrix.org) --in fact just having read up a little about it for the first time-- I'd be inclined to say that item 3. in the list above is the most important and IMO first one to consider: Determine in general terms where which type of encryption is needed for which types of data in terms of what (only message exchanges or also metadata thereof?) needs to be protected (e.g., only integrity or truly confidentiality?). \r\nIn the context of the \"quantum threat\", particularly in terms of duration of protection: Is it possible for attackers against Matrix to obtain/store (encrypted) records of data today and attack them in the future (say if a real quantum computer appears)? If so, I'd think about an \"archive\" concept that may rely on `liboqs`. But again, this is just scratching the surface.\r\nAlso pretty relevant is to know about performance and speed requirements for an application: There's wide variance between different QSC algorithms. Also to consider: Not all algorithms in `liboqs` might remain supported in the future (say, if NIST or anyone else finds flaws in them -- hence again the explicit link here to the [OQS limitations disclaimer](https://openquantumsafe.org/about/#limitations)).\r\n\r\nAll told, in my eyes the list above is OK for a first \"stock taking\" or rough evaluation to do an initial demo (e.g., to evaluate the performance impact of using QSC algorithms), but needs to be extended substantially if one wants to truly address the \"quantum threat\" for real -- particularly if message exchange is required with many different & diverse parties as seems to be the case with Matrix.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1011833822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-13T06:24:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
