Or are you saying standard chromium v94 also crashes on your ubuntu? Or only the oqs-chromium?\r\n\r\nIf the latter, I see two options: 1) Could you use an Ubuntu 20 VM? 2) We'd need to build a docker image to resolve this \"dependency craze\" for good. But as a full build alone takes many hours, doing/debugging this with a Dockerfile isn't something I'm anxiously looking forward to taking on... :-( \r\n\r\nIf the former (every chromium v94 crashing) I think only the VM-option is realistic as we don't want to support different (i.e., also older) chromium versions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1007964646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-01-08T11:29:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
