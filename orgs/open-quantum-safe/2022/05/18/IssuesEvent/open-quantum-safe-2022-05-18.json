Here is my OS information:\r\n`Linux version 5.4.0-109-generic (buildd@ubuntu) (gcc version 7.5.0 (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04)) #123~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 8 09:48:52 UTC 2022`\r\n\r\nThe certificate chain of a test group is created in this way:\r\n```\r\nRootCA\r\n├── server\r\n│   \r\n└── client\r\n```\r\nIn a test group, both server and client will be signed by the same signature algorithm.\r\n\r\nHere is some of my test result:\r\n- p521_dilithium5\r\n\r\n  > 1475 connections in 20.49s; 71.99 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  > 1475 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\n- p521\r\n\r\n  > 1170 connections in 14.99s; 78.05 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  > 1170 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\nThe result is not as my expectation. In theory, the total connection times of p521_dilithium5 should be less than p521 since p521 has a better performance than p521_dilithium5. Another point is that the user seconds spent should be less than 15s because the server and the client are doing a similar thing during the connection. But here p521_dilithium5 spends 20.49s on the client-side. \r\n\r\nTo be more convinced I reproduce the test on an AWS VM. Here is the VM information:\r\n`Linux version 5.4.0-1071-aws (buildd@lcy02-amd64-020) (gcc version 7.5.0 (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04)) #76~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Mar 28 17:49:57 UTC 2022`\r\n- p521_dilithium5\r\n\r\n  > 1106 connections in 12.92s; 85.60 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  > 1106 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n- p521\r\n\r\n  > 1246 connections in 13.16s; 94.68 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  > 1246 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\nHere the result seems to be much more reasonable. \r\n\r\nNow I am not sure does this problem happens only on my ubuntu system or is it a general problem? I only have one computer with the Ubuntu system so could anyone please help me to reproduce the test on your ubuntu system?  \r\n\r\nHere is my test file: [testFile.zip](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/files/8587935/testFile.zip)\r\n\r\nTo run the shell file, you may need to run `chmod777 start_server` and `chmod777 start_test` first\r\n\r\nTo start the server, run:\r\n`./start_server ALGO PROT` e.g. `./start_server prime521v1 4433`\r\n\r\nThen start the test:\r\n`./start_test ALGO PROT` e.g. `./start_test prime521v1 4433`\r\n\r\nThanks a lot if anyone would like to help me! \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-05-18T18:12:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
