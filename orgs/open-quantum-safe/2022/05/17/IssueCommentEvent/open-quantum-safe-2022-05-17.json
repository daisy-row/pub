I haven't done proper testing to see if features were detected properly since I got the above linking issue.\r\n\r\nI made a quick test to see if my install FreeBSD had it defined for some reason, but it appears it doesn't either so I'm a bit confused why the liboqs build in ports gets past compiling common.c at all. \r\n\r\nIt looks like `__FreeBSD__` is set (verified by compiling my test c program), so I updated the branch to use that variable. Hopefully that resolves the issue you are experiencing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1128758677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-05-17T11:34:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
