The other KEMs only allow an implicit check if decapsulation was successful by comparing the original with the decapsulated message, while the return code is always OQS_SUCCESS. This is mainly to prevent leaking information.\r\nAs with the negative KEM tests in liboqs, the tests here let both behavior pass. But we may want to document this behavior or add an extra test for it.\r\n\r\nFixes #57 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1139778074","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/58#issuecomment-1139778074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/58","id":1139778074,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l85D76Ia","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-27T16:31:16Z","updated_at":"2022-05-27T16:31:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Would it be reasonable to add an explanation (explicit list?) to the README regarding the hybrids supported by `oqsprovider` (as for L1 & L3 there's now still the additional X... hybrids that are not supported/mentioned at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl#supported-algorithms that we otherwise link to)?\r\n\r\nI added a description to the README about the additional x25519/x448 hybrids, similar to the description in OQS-OpenSSL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Finally, I'd definitely suggest adding wording/warning that the algorithms (except HQC as you state) effectively don't support the OpenSSL API (not returning an error code when they failed) -- I'd be fine not mentioning this if there'd be wider agreement that \"silent failure\" is an acceptable security feature, e.g., by adding an explicit statement to this effect to https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/EVP_PKEY_decapsulate.html) .\r\n\r\nYes I agree. For now I added a note to the README.
