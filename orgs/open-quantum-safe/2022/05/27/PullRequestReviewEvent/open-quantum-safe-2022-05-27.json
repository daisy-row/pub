Indeed, the \"X-algs\" were not properly matched. Thanks also for the additional negative sig test.

The other KEMs only allow an implicit check if decapsulation was successful by comparing the original with the decapsulated message, while the return code is always OQS_SUCCESS. This is mainly to prevent leaking information.\r\nAs with the negative KEM tests in liboqs, the tests here let both behavior pass. But we may want to document this behavior or add an extra test for it.\r\n\r\nFixes #57
