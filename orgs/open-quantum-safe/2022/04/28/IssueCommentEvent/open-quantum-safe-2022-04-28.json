I use Ubuntu. I've made a very simple `Dockerfile`\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM emscripten/emsdk:latest \r\nRUN apt -y update\r\nRUN apt -y install astyle cmake gcc ninja-build libssl-dev python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist unzip xsltproc doxygen graphviz python3-yaml\r\nRUN git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git \r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the procedure.\r\n\r\n1. Create a directory that contains only the `Dockerfile`\r\n2. Go to that directory to build a local docker image named `oqs_wasm`:\r\n`sudo docker build -t oqs_wasm .`\r\n3. Run that image:\r\n`sudo docker run -it oqs_wasm`\r\n4. Now, you have a fully configured WASM build environment running in a ubuntu container. The `oqs `resides under `/src/liboqs`\r\n5. So, create the build directory under that:\r\n```\r\ncd /src/liboqs/\r\nmkdir build && cd build\r\n```\r\n6. Now, you are under `/src/liboqs/build`\r\n7. Similar to the `oqs `build process, the WASM build process is prefixed with the Emscripten command as follows:\r\n```\r\nemcmake cmake -GNinja -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF -DOQS_PERMIT_UNSUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURE=ON ..\r\nemmake ninja\r\n```\r\n8.
