Here is a mini doc.\r\n\r\n1. Install the the [Emscripten ](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)\r\n\r\n2. Similar to the `oqs `build process, the WASM build process is prefixed with the Emscripten command as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nemcmake cmake -GNinja -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF -DOQS_PERMIT_UNSUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURE=ON ..\r\nemmake ninja\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Done. It is that simple.\r\n\r\nBy the way, `wasmer `should work too if you use the above `-D` switches.\r\n\r\nThe `oqs `source code seems structured very well. It has a \"generic\" target. Its assembly code does not prevent those pure C code from working. Its runtime fails graciously when the build target is not compiled to fulfill a task, most likely because the target like WASM cannot accept assembly code. For example, instead of crashing, it would print out something like this: `KEM algorithm BIKE-L1 not enabled!`\r\n\r\nKeep up with the great work. Thanks.\r\n\r\nJust a friendly reminder. I hope you keep in mind that WASM, representing the web, should be considered a legitimate target. If it is considered \"generic\", that is fine, as long as it contains only pure (free from assembly code, inline or not) C/C++ code that is not contaminated by the vendor-dependent features such as Linux/Windows system calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1107935005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-24T23:02:08Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
