Three questions to this:\r\na) Would it be OK we add reference to the above as a section to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Platform-specific-notes-for-building-liboqs ?\r\nb) Would you consider contributing a WASM-ready demo environment/docker image (at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos)?\r\nc) Would you consider contributing to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling, adding comparative (performance) tests between classic and QS-crypto using WASM (e.g. comparing to [WebCrypto](https://www.chromium.org/blink/webcrypto/))? I personally still have doubts WASM-compiled crypto code can be useful if too slow... But then again, signature operations are not necessarily performance-sensitive (unlike heavy-duty stream ciphers or KEXs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1108120562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-25T06:17:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
