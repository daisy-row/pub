The certificate chain of a test group is created in this way: \r\n```\r\nRootCA\r\n├── SecondCA\r\n│   └──server certificate\r\n└── ThirdCA\r\n     └── client certificate\r\n```\r\nThe signature algorithms used by RootCA, SecondCA, and ThirdCA are the same. \r\n\r\nI create many groups with different hybrid algorithms: rsa3072_dilithium2, rsa3072_dilithium2_aes, rsa3072_falcon512, p256_dilithium2, p256_dilithium2_aes, p256_falcon512, p384_dilithium3, p384_dilithium3_aes, p521_dilithium5, p521_dilithium5_aes, p521_falcon1024.\r\n\r\nI first start the sever on AWS EC2 instance:\r\n`openssl s_server -key $1_test/server/server.key -cert_chain $1_test/secondCA/demoCA/secondCA.pem  -cert $1_test/server/server.pem -accept $2 -CAfile $1_test/client/client_chain.pem -verify_return_error -Verify 2 -state -WWW ` \r\n\r\nThen I will run `s_client` on local to test the connection:\r\n`openssl s_client -key $1_test/client/client.key  -cert $1_test/client/client.pem -connect ec2_ip:$2 -CAfile $1_test/rootCA/demoCA/root.pem -verify_return_error -state`\r\n**The connection tests using `s_client` are ok for all groups. Therefore, I think the created certificate chain should be right**\r\n\r\nFinally I run `s_time` on local to test the performance:\r\n`openssl s_time -key $1_test/client/client.key -cert $1_test/client/client.pem -connect ec2_ip:$2 -CAfile $1_test/rootCA/demoCA/root.pem -new`\r\nThe performance test using `s_time` for RSA combined algorithms are working well. **However, many problems for P256 combined algorithms.** \r\n\r\n- For  p256_dilithium2 and p256_dilithium2_aes, the server could not receive early data\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-04-13 11-18-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60347669/163135545-92e379c6-1a97-4dea-9c63-8a73e5ac1c14.png)\r\n- For p384_dilithium3, p384_dilithium3_aes, p521_dilithium5, p521_dilithium5_aes, and p521_falcon1024.
