I also tried on a desktop (VM) but got the same error messages. If you simply run the commands above the error message is output straight away. What really is surprising is that the pretty strange error message \"a function declaration without a prototype is deprecated in all versions of C\" is output: This simply cannot be the case as `liboqs` is built with many different versions of C compilers -- and none of them (bar this `/emsdk/upstream/bin/clang`) complains about this... I'd have the impression it doesn't find the header files, but `-Iinclude` is present on the compiler invocation... Will wait to hear from you before adding the instructions to the \"Platform build\" wiki.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1109644653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-26T10:48:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
