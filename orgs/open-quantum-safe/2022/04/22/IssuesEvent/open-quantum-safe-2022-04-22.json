It never intends to make the library link-only because its permissive MIT license encourages the user to reference the source code directly. Header-only projects would server a wider community. For example, any WASM applications will automatically build because it is just a matter of a single `#include <oqs.h>` statement in the existing applications without any modification of the existing build process.\r\n\r\nThe renowned `Boost C++` project is a credible header-only example. The [Quantum++](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp) in the quantum computing community is another good example.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-22T05:19:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
