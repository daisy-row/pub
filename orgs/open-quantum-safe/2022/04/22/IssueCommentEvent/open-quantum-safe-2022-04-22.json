Arguably, all code/components do exist for most (i.e, the [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/)) algorithms that would allow adding such switch to the `cmake` build structures in the project, though. \r\n\r\nYou could get _very far_ already using the build option combination [OQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#OQS_DIST_BUILD) [OQS_OPT_TARGET=generic](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#oqs_opt_target) [OQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#oqs_use_openssl) as that combination should disable including all optimization code parts (i.e., assembly code).\r\n\r\nSo, please give the above a try, feel free to do a PR if you need this or provide us with information why we should spend work cycles on this: I personally have doubts anyone would want to use slow-running cryptography...
