Any indication there could be wider uptake interest for this (either use as-is or PR into upstream openssh-portable)? Or alternatively, do a \"clean-slate\" liboqs (KEM-only) PR based on OpenSSH-v9?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it could wait. Based on what NIST picks OpenSSH or OQS OpenSSH may need to change. Also, still carrying all KEMs now seems like an overkill since we are close to getting the algorithms that we should focus fist. And experimentation is already taking place with the current OQS projects. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would wait for NIST and to see what will happen in IETF with [draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh-00). Better for everyone to have a spec to chase after instead of trying to comply with each other. We saw that with the PQ Hybrid TLS draft as well. \r\n\r\nJust my thoughts.
