Apologies for not adding the same effort to OQS-OpenSSL1.1.1 but for new (OQS-openssl) functionality my preference is to focus on a more future-proof code base (i.e., OpenSSL 3.x). Please let us know why this wouldn't work for you and provide concrete (oqs-openssl111-based) commands that don't work. Until then, closing the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/1053949479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-02-28T07:03:32Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
