At a quick glance it looked like the on-wire formats for PQ/hybrid keys and messages didn't change from v7 to v8, and so I thought there was a good chance these were compatible, and they should still interop over whatever intersection of ciphersuites remain common between the versions.\r\n\r\nI first want to look at updating the templates for libssh to match v8's ciphersuites exactly instead of the intersection, so we can test interop with all of them. This would also eliminate the need for v7. If this proves problematic for some reason, then I'll look at just swapping v8 in for the tests.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, it would be good to document which (version of) libssh oqs-libssh has been branched off from.

Related question: Why is this repo no fork of https://git.libssh.org/projects/libssh.git?\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch here is the upstream's master branch, although I copied it manually. The local version of `master` is also the current branch-off point for this work. I can note that commit ID in the README. I didn't duplicate the other branches and tags from upstream, as I didn't see a need. (If there's a way in GitHub to make a fork from a repo not hosted on GitHub, I was unaware of it.) So even if it's not an \"official\" work as far as GitHub is concerned, the history is still there to allow merging libssh's official master in to take updates when we want.\r\n\r\nThere have been no official releases of 0.10 yet, so I have no tag to snap to. The branch-off pointed ended up being the head of master at the time. A potentially interested customer also said they tracked `master` for their use, rather than the 0.9 release branch, and so I did so as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/libssh/issues/comments/1028140262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-02-02T16:50:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
