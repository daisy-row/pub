They call `sshbuf_reserve` and pass a pointer directly into the buffer contents to `OQS_KEM_encaps` or `_decaps`. The SSH spec requires the shared secret input to the KDF to be in the mpint format, which has 4 bytes of length prepended to it. This causes the keys to be derived in a manner not compliant with the spec. In `kex_derive_keys`, `shared_secret` ends up being 16 bytes, for example, when it should be 20 (4 bytes length + 16 bytes secret).\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/0c5eac6a3ba249f73bb953745cf109bdf281eafd/kexoqs.c#L91-L98 for encrypting, and https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/0c5eac6a3ba249f73bb953745cf109bdf281eafd/kexoqs.c#L130-L135 for decrypting.\r\n\r\nThe v7.9 branch had this correct, and there's even a note calling it out at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/f41bbe652c522db1bec388f82db369e4e5f0f405/kexpqoqsc.c#L297-L310 and https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/f41bbe652c522db1bec388f82db369e4e5f0f405/kexpqoqss.c#L282-L295. The shared secret data there is written into the buffer as an ssh_string, which prepends the same 4 bytes of length that makes it conform to the mpint format.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I believe the hybrid case is correct, but I haven't been able to test it yet. `kex_kem_generic_with_ec_enc` and `kex_kem_generic_with_ec_dec` both write the shared secret to the relevant buffer with `sshbuf_put_string`, in the same way the v7.9 code does, and so the prepended length should be present.
