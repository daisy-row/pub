Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller.

Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases

Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases

Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases
