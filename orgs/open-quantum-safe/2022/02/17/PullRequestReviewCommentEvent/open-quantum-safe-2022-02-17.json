Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases instead.","created_at":"2022-02-17T00:11:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T01:24:23Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3168f065634d095ed104f7101388ca001a66c8c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/statuses/c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","head":{"label":"kevinmkane:libssh-v8-fixes","ref":"libssh-v8-fixes","sha":"c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","user":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315723191,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU3MjMxOTE=","name":"openssh","full_name":"kevinmkane/openssh","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane/openssh","description":"Fork

Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases instead.","created_at":"2022-02-17T00:11:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T01:34:34Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3168f065634d095ed104f7101388ca001a66c8c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/statuses/c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","head":{"label":"kevinmkane:libssh-v8-fixes","ref":"libssh-v8-fixes","sha":"c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","user":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315723191,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU3MjMxOTE=","name":"openssh","full_name":"kevinmkane/openssh","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane/openssh","description":"Fork

Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases instead.","created_at":"2022-02-17T00:11:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T01:50:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3168f065634d095ed104f7101388ca001a66c8c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/statuses/c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","head":{"label":"kevinmkane:libssh-v8-fixes","ref":"libssh-v8-fixes","sha":"c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","user":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315723191,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU3MjMxOTE=","name":"openssh","full_name":"kevinmkane/openssh","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane/openssh","description":"Fork

Increase MAX_PROP to 160. Large numbers of proposals due to all the OQS algorithms can cause a non-spec-compliant selection of algorithm if this value is too low and client and server order their proposals differently. This had been fixed in v7 by #85 but returned in the v8 branch.\r\n2. When calling `ssh-keygen` with the `-t` parameter to specify the key type for one of the ECDSA hybrids, but using the short name instead of the full `ssh-ecdsa-xxxxxxx` name, ECDSA keys would always be generated on P-256. Instead, always use the specified curve.\r\n3. `kex_kem_generic_{enc,dec}` could use an uninitialized variable as the return value if the call to the underlying liboqs function failed. On the small chance that variable happened to have a zero in it, this would look like a successful result to teh caller. Return `SSH_ERR_LIBCRYPTO_ERROR` in these cases instead.","created_at":"2022-02-17T00:11:42Z","updated_at":"2022-02-17T15:59:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3168f065634d095ed104f7101388ca001a66c8c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/statuses/c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","head":{"label":"kevinmkane:libssh-v8-fixes","ref":"libssh-v8-fixes","sha":"c7a220a14af52451e667b4f957295fea71e98192","user":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315723191,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU3MjMxOTE=","name":"openssh","full_name":"kevinmkane/openssh","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinmkane","id":18724089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NzI0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18724089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinmkane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinmkane/openssh","description":"Fork
