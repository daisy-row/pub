To minimize code changes and avoid losing performance we could use max-(param-)size array allocations combined with globally set variables replacing the current defines. HOWEVER, this would\r\n- create smaller executables benefiting primarily (users of) embedded platforms\r\n- with ([in the case of SPHINCS+ particularly high](https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/visualization/mem_sig.html)) runtime memory consumption hurting those very same embedded platforms\r\n\r\nSo... lots of work to create a \"mixed-bag\" result. Besides, users of embedded platforms could (and probably should) build `liboqs` only with those (few) algorithms/parameter sets that make sense on those platforms and leave all others away -- also optimizing code size-- without additional work on our side.\r\n\r\n> But we would be able to eliminate having lots of source code for each different variant, at the cost of having more complex CMake files.\r\n\r\nThe number of source files is pretty irrelevant in my eyes: They're \"invisible\" to all users (and most developers). It's the result that counts/is executed/stored much more often (than it is compiled). And adding complexity is nearly always not a good thing. \r\n\r\nIn sum, I withdraw my suggestion -- particularly for this algorithm :-/ Apologies for the spam in this issue.

The recently merged workaround (https://github.com/sphincs/sphincsplus/pull/26) that should make the upstream code work with MSVC (in theory) is a set of `#ifdefs` (what else) that turn the `SPX_VLA` macro into `_alloca` calls on MSVC. It should be possible to extend this approach to all of SPHINCS+ where necessary to replace lengths currently hardcoded via the parameterset constants. \r\n\r\nI'm probably going to adopt the VLA approach in the PQClean impls, by the way, as nobody has presented a compelling argument why we should *not* have VLAs in the reference code.
