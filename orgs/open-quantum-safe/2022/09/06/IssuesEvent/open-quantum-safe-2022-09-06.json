As a user of a GNU-Linux system, Fedora (**kernel 5.18**), i came to read, somehow lately, about SSH-relared projects, yet on this platform. I could notice that section _Quick-start_ was written against a release that is not obsolete but yet old. Might the statements of that section be still valid against an up-to-date release, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 'Jammy Jellyfish' (**kernel 5.15**) or even Debian 11.4 'bullseye' (**kernel 5.10**)? As my interest for this project kept on growing, i came to notice several unknowns: I hope i haven't missed any, as you may discover more by your own as well. Here they are:\r\n\r\n- I conceived that the lack of mention in regard to the **post-quantum cryptographic primitives** sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com and chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com – introduced in [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) respectively in version 8.5, now as default in 9.0 and 6.5, promoted to be the default cipher in 6.9 – have been so for reason. Nevertheless a such lack might certainly justify the introduction of a pedagogic statement covering the motive to not having them made eligible for being introduced within liboqs. Closest mention here in respect to the key exchange sntrup761 when being as part of sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com, is the key exchange ntruprime-sntrup761-sha384. However unknown to me whether those key exchanges whose mentions differ express the same algorithm. \r\n\r\nAs prerequisite is assumed | Algorithms present within liboqs were enabled thus supported. \r\n\r\n- As stated, for that <KEX> ntruprime-sntrup761-sha384 listed one of the hybrid algorithm among level L1, L3 and L5 security, is made available. Though unknown are the respective level codes security of supported key exchange methods. Suggestions of syntaxes in this regard, here applied to _NTRU-PRIME_, as model:\r\n  - **NTRU-PRIME**: \r\n_level L3 security_ | ntruprime-ntrulpr653-sha256, ntruprime-sntrup653-sha256\r\n_level L3 security_ | ntruprime-ntrulpr761-sha384, ntruprime-sntrup761-sha384, ntruprime-ntrulpr857-sha384\r\n_level L5 security_ | ntruprime-sntrup857-sha384, ntruprime-ntrulpr1277-sha512, ntruprime-sntrup1277-sha512\r\n\r\n- It seems to me that no implementation of digital signing method for sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com has been implemented in any software yet. In this project, digital signing appears to be implemented. THough unknown is the digital signature algorithm ntruprime-sntrup761-sha384 is eligible to be associated to.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-06T10:52:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
