Google [upgraded](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/5511fa833c96c8caa9b51c13367f057c74d850eb) to a more version of Go. The [go.mod](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/blob/master/go.mod) file claims it needs v1.13, but it actually needs v1.16 (when [os.ReadFile](https://pkg.go.dev/os#ReadFile)) was added to the `os` package). Our Docker images use [v1.14](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers/blob/main/ubuntu-focal/Dockerfile#L12), so it seems that the simplest fix is to update these (using this download link: https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz).
