Only with this change the test passes OK when Frodo640AES is not configured in (for \"STD\" and \"NIST_R4\" configs). The logic for this change was that if Frodo is not active there's no error in the library/configuration or the test. It's simply that Frodo is not there.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to re-write the whole test to \"dynamically\" select an algorithm that is available (e.g., by introducing yet another C-level config variable -- that could be dependent on the new `OQS_ALGS_ENABLED` `cmake`-level define). This would change the focus in this example code  from the simple \"this is how to use one specific algorithm\" to \"this is how to configure liboqs for use with different algorithms\", though: Would that be OK from your perspective?","created_at":"2022-12-19T06:23:03Z","updated_at":"2022-12-19T06:23:03Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1333#discussion_r1051848336","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1333","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1051848336"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1333#discussion_r1051848336"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1333"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1051848336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":45,"original_line":45,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1051658394},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1333","id":1165197204,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5Fc3-U","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1333","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1333.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1333.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1333","number":1333,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Enable algorithm filtering","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Fixes #1331 \r\n\r\n* [ No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?
