I.e., BoringSSL's CI runs an OpenSSL interop?\r\n\r\nNo. This highlights the issue: BoringSSL's CI and interop testing is not at the same level as that of OQS-OpenSSL/oqsprovider. We (also therefore) once decided to \"demote\" it from \"OQS-supported\" status, but now seem to have reverted that decision in the interest of retaining Chromium demo-only support. This means a \"second class/demo-only\" BoringSSL can hold back (a whole chain of supported) OpenSSL use cases. \r\n\r\nSo I'd suggest we either decide to \"promote\" BoringSSL again to \"fully supported\" (but then need to first do PRs for that before merging \"breaking\" `liboqs` changes) OR move the \"onus of interop testing\" to the \"second class citizen\" BoringSSL: If interop issues happen then, it only breaks CI for BoringSSL and someone may (or may not :) care. \r\n\r\nMy personal opinion is clear: [Do (BoringSSL/OpenSSL) interop testing only in BoringSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/96).
