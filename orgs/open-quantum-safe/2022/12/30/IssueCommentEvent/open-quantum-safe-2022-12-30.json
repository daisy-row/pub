It operates on the assumption that the user has openssl-oqs installed onto their local machine. As a result, it is unable to find the openssl-oqs binary within the ubuntu circleci docker image used for testing. \r\n\r\nAt that point, my options were either to (1) add another block in the circleci to install openssl-oqs inside the image for key generation, (2) create a docker image executable as a binary that invokes the openssl binary, or (3) re-add the post-quantum certs to the /tls/certs folder\r\n\r\nIf you have a better solution to the above issue, please let me know. However, the circleci \"\"\"should\"\"\" work now.\r\n\r\nThank you for your patience, I hope you are having a great holiday","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1368021301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-30T17:23:36Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
