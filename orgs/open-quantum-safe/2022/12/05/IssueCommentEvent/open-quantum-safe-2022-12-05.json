What might be good as an additional check is an interop test with oqs-OpenSSL111. There seems to be a script for that but the tests don't seem to use it (?). But then again, we're not really supporting boringssl, so interop probably never was an interest.\r\n\r\nThanks @baentsch. Interop with our test server works; e.g.: `./tool/bssl client -curves p384_kyber768 -connect test.openquantumsafe.org:6042` succeeds. (This is the purpose of the `oqs_scripts/test_with_interop_server.py` script, but it doesn't work for me; I'd however rather address that in a different issue/PR.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/comments/1336604297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-05T01:34:42Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
