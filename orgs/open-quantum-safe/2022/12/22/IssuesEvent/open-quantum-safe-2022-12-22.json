This issue is to collect options how to handle this: \r\nInitial ideas:\r\n1) Don't care, i.e., do not support/perform (CI) testing with \"standard-only\" algorithm selections.\r\n2) Create a possibly convoluted script to filter algorithms under test in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/oqs-test/common.py using information from \"oqsconfig.h\" (un-set #defines).\r\n3) Add code throughout oqs-openssl to explicitly permit unavailability of an algorithm, possibly guarded by an environment variable \"OQS_TEST_ONLY\".\r\n\r\nPreferences? Further alternatives? @xvzcf @dstebila @christianpaquin ?\r\n\r\nOptions 1 (not testing what is actually deployed) and 3 (possibly extensive code changes for test-only behaviour changes) have such undesirable consequences that I personally think 2 ought to be implemented.
