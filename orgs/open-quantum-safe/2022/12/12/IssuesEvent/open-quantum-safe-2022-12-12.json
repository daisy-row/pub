[](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.0)\r\n2) OpenIKED (VPN )ships with ntru-prime as well. [](https://github.com/openiked/openiked-portable/releases/tag/v7.0)\r\n3) Putty now support ntru prime. [](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html)\r\n\r\nAnd the removal of NTRU-prime breaks a popular SSH library which relies on liboqs-python for interop with OpenSSH:\r\nhttps://github.com/ronf/asyncssh\r\n\r\nA PR was sent for your consideration as well: [](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1328)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-12T10:11:28Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
