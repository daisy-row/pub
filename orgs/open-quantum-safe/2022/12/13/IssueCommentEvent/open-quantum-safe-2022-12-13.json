Removing NTRU prime breaks interop between asyncssh and OpenSSH. \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback -- very much in line with @dstebila 's [comment](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1245#issuecomment-1223375957)\r\n\r\n> Ah, I see what you're getting at: other SSH implementations that want to interop with OpenSSH will need an implementation of strnup761, and liboqs would be a convenient source for that, speaking to keeping strnup761 in liboqs. Duly noted, let's take that under consideration. Do you know if there any other algorithms from the NTRU Prime family that are relevant? If we can even prune it down to just strnup761 and remove code for the rest of them, that would be helpful.\r\n\r\n#1329 adds all NTRUPrime algs back, though -- would it be possible/sensible/sufficient to modify the PR such that it only brings back the algorithm(s) needed for OpenSSH?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1347814406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-13T06:35:07Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
