I only found [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/164#issuecomment-1330749077) -- and it doesn't look OK. Also, does this confirmation refer to the \"wolfssl\" flavour or the \"OQS\" flavour -- which is the default here? I'm still surprised seeing the define `OQS_KEM` used to carry signature names: That does not look right: KEMs and SIGs are clearly separated [in the OQS master file here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/qsc.h). I do understand that this approach can work for signatures in the \"manipulated\" `wolfssl-qsc.h\" file but not for the \"OQS\" version: Hence the question: What confirmation (using which setup) has been given?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1331702463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-30T06:32:34Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

WIP - DO NOT MERGE ðŸš¨\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate to commit [f0518d](https://github.com/google/boringssl/commit/f0518d45119dd4dd322a884669daf8247bc3c992).\r\n\r\n**Note:** Some tests still fail, see output of `ninja run_tests` below.\r\n\r\nCompiled on Windows x64, Apple silicon (ARM), macOS 13.0.\r\n\r\nFYI, compilation for x86 works the same, to do so on an M1/M2 Mac - add to `CMakeLists.txt` (both to BSSL and `liboqs`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSET(CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES \"x86_64\" CACHE INTERNAL \"\" FORCE)\r\nSET(CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET \"10.13.0\" CACHE INTERNAL \"\"

PR def needs more attention on my end (initial draft PR mostly for PoC purposes and to see that tests pass), intending on doing a round of polish later today.
