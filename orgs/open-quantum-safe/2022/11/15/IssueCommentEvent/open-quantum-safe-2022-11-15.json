Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nThis PR is focused on resolving the inconsistencies mentioned in #1304.\r\n\r\n- [X] C_OR_NI_OR_ARM not working in distributable builds on ARM. \r\n- [x] Are the OQS_USE_ARM_*_INSTRUCTIONS flags actually being set?\r\n- [X] Update `tests/system_info.c` macros for AES and SHA2 implementation selection to match those used in `src/common/aes/aes.c` and `/src/common/sha2/sha2.c`\r\n- [X] ARM profiling scripts using cross-compilation toolchains\r\n- [x] Sanity check *which* optimizations are actually being used\r\n\r\nCurrently I believe that I have resolved points 1 and 3, and still need to look into 2. @baentsch, Douglas mentioned you may have resolved the profiling scripts issue, is that the case?\r\n\r\nA couple of notes:\r\n- I have reformatted the AES C_OR_NI_OR_ARM macros to match the formatting of the ones we use in SHA2. I have also renamed the sha2_ni.c to sha2_armv8.c after realizing that ni didn't strand for 'native instructions'.\r\n- We were *never* using the AES optimization for distributed builds. When I fixed the issue with the macro, we had linking issues which are now resolved. This could have possibly been the issue @dstebila noticed in point 2?\r\n- I still need to verify that this does indeed fix everything, but wanted to create a draft PR in case there is anything to discuss.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
