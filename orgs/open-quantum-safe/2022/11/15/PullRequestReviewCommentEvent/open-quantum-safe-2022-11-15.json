I have also renamed the sha2_ni.c to sha2_armv8.c after realizing that ni didn't strand for 'native instructions'.\r\n- We were *never* using the AES optimization for distributed builds. When I fixed the issue with the macro, we had linking issues which are now resolved. This could have possibly been the issue @dstebila noticed in point 2?\r\n- I still need to verify that this does indeed fix everything, but wanted to create a draft PR in case there is anything to discuss.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

I have also renamed the sha2_ni.c to sha2_armv8.c after realizing that ni didn't strand for 'native instructions'.\r\n- We were *never* using the AES optimization for distributed builds. When I fixed the issue with the macro, we had linking issues which are now resolved. This could have possibly been the issue @dstebila noticed in point 2?\r\n- I still need to verify that this does indeed fix everything, but wanted to create a draft PR in case there is anything to discuss.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

I have also renamed the sha2_ni.c to sha2_armv8.c after realizing that ni didn't strand for 'native instructions'.\r\n- We were *never* using the AES optimization for distributed builds. When I fixed the issue with the macro, we had linking issues which are now resolved. This could have possibly been the issue @dstebila noticed in point 2?\r\n- I still need to verify that this does indeed fix everything, but wanted to create a draft PR in case there is anything to discuss.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
