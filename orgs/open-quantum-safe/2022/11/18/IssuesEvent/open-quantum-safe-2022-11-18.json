If resources are constrained, then only enabling the Kyber variants (and perhaps the fallback NTRU) would suffice. These are likely be the first deployed algs in practice, so this data would be insightful. Perf tests with these algs will also be run in the NCCoE projects, so having a basis for comparison would help.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/83/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/83/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-18T17:10:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
