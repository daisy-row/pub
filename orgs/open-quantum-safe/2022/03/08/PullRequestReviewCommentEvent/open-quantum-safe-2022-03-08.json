I could of things to point out:\r\n1) pqclean's implementation of Dilithium does not support randomized signing. After a discussion with @dstebila, I have patched the arm implementation so that it only supports randomized signing. This was done instead of pushing to upstream since we are only pulling one implementation of dilithium from pqclean. Once upstream gets patched to support randomized signing, then this patch will need to be revised.\r\n\r\n2) The `pqclean_name`s in the `copy_from_upstream.yml` file have been updated to match the formatting in pqclean's repo. This caused several of the dilithium folders to be renamed. I think that might be part of why the ci is failing currently, but I'm not sure. All tests pass on my M1 mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

I could of things to point out:\r\n1) pqclean's implementation of Dilithium does not support randomized signing. After a discussion with @dstebila, I have patched the arm implementation so that it only supports randomized signing. This was done instead of pushing to upstream since we are only pulling one implementation of dilithium from pqclean. Once upstream gets patched to support randomized signing, then this patch will need to be revised.\r\n\r\n2) The `pqclean_name`s in the `copy_from_upstream.yml` file have been updated to match the formatting in pqclean's repo. This caused several of the dilithium folders to be renamed. I think that might be part of why the ci is failing currently, but I'm not sure. All tests pass on my M1 mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

I could of things to point out:\r\n1) pqclean's implementation of Dilithium does not support randomized signing. After a discussion with @dstebila, I have patched the arm implementation so that it only supports randomized signing. This was done instead of pushing to upstream since we are only pulling one implementation of dilithium from pqclean. Once upstream gets patched to support randomized signing, then this patch will need to be revised.\r\n\r\n2) The `pqclean_name`s in the `copy_from_upstream.yml` file have been updated to match the formatting in pqclean's repo. This caused several of the dilithium folders to be renamed. I think that might be part of why the ci is failing currently, but I'm not sure. All tests pass on my M1 mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

I could of things to point out:\r\n1) pqclean's implementation of Dilithium does not support randomized signing. After a discussion with @dstebila, I have patched the arm implementation so that it only supports randomized signing. This was done instead of pushing to upstream since we are only pulling one implementation of dilithium from pqclean. Once upstream gets patched to support randomized signing, then this patch will need to be revised.\r\n\r\n2) The `pqclean_name`s in the `copy_from_upstream.yml` file have been updated to match the formatting in pqclean's repo. This caused several of the dilithium folders to be renamed. I think that might be part of why the ci is failing currently, but I'm not sure. All tests pass on my M1 mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

I could of things to point out:\r\n1) pqclean's implementation of Dilithium does not support randomized signing. After a discussion with @dstebila, I have patched the arm implementation so that it only supports randomized signing. This was done instead of pushing to upstream since we are only pulling one implementation of dilithium from pqclean. Once upstream gets patched to support randomized signing, then this patch will need to be revised.\r\n\r\n2) The `pqclean_name`s in the `copy_from_upstream.yml` file have been updated to match the formatting in pqclean's repo. This caused several of the dilithium folders to be renamed. I think that might be part of why the ci is failing currently, but I'm not sure. All tests pass on my M1 mac.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
