I don't have a specific application to point to, but one of the first things that come to mind nowadays is the secure communication pattern of a network of nodes running a consensus protocol within a blockchain. \r\nIn the case of VPNs I recently ran into the idea behind [PeerVPN](https://peervpn.net/) (which does not seem to be maintained) where instead of having a central VPN gateway, i.e., a single point of failure, one could have multiple gateways connected through a mesh topology and communicating in a peer to peer fashion.
