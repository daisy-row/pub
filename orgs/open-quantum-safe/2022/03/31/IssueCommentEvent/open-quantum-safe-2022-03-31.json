I very much like the set-up incl. documentation.\r\n\r\nBefore giving definite feedback on the PR, can I ask why you chose to check in to git CA cert and key? From a security perspective this isn't advisable. Is there a reason why these files can't be generated during the creation of the Docker image? \r\n\r\nThe second question is similar and pertains to the file \"kem_list.txt\": Why is it necessary to check this in to this repository? By doing so, this docker image will immediately break when OQS-OpenSSL gets updated with new code points. Wouldn't it be better to extract it from the (then-current) OQS-OpenSSL branch used during the docker build?\r\n\r\nFinally, please also consider updating your Dockerfile to build `liboqs` with maximum portability as the resultant docker image may run on a wide range of machines, including ones that don't match the CPU features of the machine the image has been built on. For an example see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/blob/9102232f2de9701ce71707bf3332ef0c5531e9fb/curl/Dockerfile#L9-L10 and check out https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#OQS_DIST_BUILD","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1084734858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-03-31T15:16:43Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Thus, if you generate a CA key+cert as part of `docker build` no certificate exchange is required (as long as both client and server do use the same docker image), right?
