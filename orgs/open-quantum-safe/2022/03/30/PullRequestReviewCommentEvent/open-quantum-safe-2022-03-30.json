The variable `OQS_SERVER` must contain the FQDN of the server running the instance.\n+\n+Additionally, information for connecting to the server is generated into the file `/etc/openvpn/CLIENTNAME.ovpn` and can be used to connect to the server.\n+\n+If you try this on your local computer, all required steps for installing client and server into a docker image in its own docker network are thus :\n+\n+```\n+export OQS_DATA=\"ovpn-data-oqstest\"\n+\n+export OQS_NETWORK=\"oqsopenvpntestnet\"\n+\n+export OQS_SERVER=\"oqsopenvpnserver\"\n+\n+export OQS_CLIENT=\"oqsopenvpnclient\"\n+\n+docker volume create --name $OQS_DATA\n+docker network create $OQS_NETWORK\n+\n+docker run -v $OQS_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn sh -c \"ovpn_genconfig -u udp://$OQS_SERVER && EASYRSA_BATCH=1 ovpn_initpki nopass && EASYRSA_BATCH=1 easyrsa build-client-full CLIENTNAME nopass && ovpn_getclient CLIENTNAME > /etc/openvpn/CLIENTNAME.ovpn\"\n+\n+docker run --rm --name $OQS_SERVER --net $OQS_NETWORK -v $OQS_DATA:/etc/openvpn -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN openquantumsafe/openvpn \n+docker run --rm --name $OQS_CLIENT --net $OQS_NETWORK -v $OQS_DATA:/etc/openvpn --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -it openquantumsafe/openvpn clientstart.sh\n+\n+docker kill $OQS_SERVER $OQS_CLIENT\n+docker network rm $OQS_NETWORK\n+docker volume rm $OQS_DATA\n+\n+```\n+\n+The last three commands clean up all data structures established.\n+\n+## Advanced usage options\n+\n+The docker image has been pre-configured to use the quantum-safe crypto (QSC) algorithm family \"Kyber\" for key establishment but any plain or hybrid QSC algorithm [supported -- see list here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable#key-exchange) can be selected. To do so, edit the file(s) `/opt/oqssa/bin/serverstart.sh` and `/opt/oqssa/bin/clientstart.sh` suitably as per the comments in those files. Alternatively, change the value for \"Groups\" in the OpenSSL configuration file `/opt/oqssa/ssl/openssl.cnf` to reflect the QSC KEM algorithm list to be used.\n+\n+## Disclaimer\n+\n+[THIS IS NOT FIT
