While this result is not as my expect because ECDSA should have better performance than RSA in theory. I check the result and I found that handshake with RSA in fact connect less times than handshake with P256 but they have a smaller \"user time\". Here is an example:\r\n\t\r\n- For P256:\r\n 19230 connections in **16.70s**; 1151.50 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n 19230 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\n- For RSA:\r\n  7247 connections in **5.31s**; 1364.78 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  7247 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\nThat is why RSA seems perform better than P256\r\n\r\nI suspect that this user time is inaccurate so I conduct a further test\r\nI set two Groups of server-client:\r\nGroup1 contain a Server1 with a RSA3072 certificate and a Client1 with a ECDSAP256 certificate\r\nGroup2 contain a Server2 with a ECDSAP256 certificate and a Client2 with a RSA3072 certificate\r\n\r\nThe test commands are here:\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_server -key $1_test/server/server.key -cert $1_test/server/server.pem -accept 4433 -CAfile $1_test/rootCA/demoCA/root.pem -verify_return_error -Verify 1 -www -state\r\n```\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_time -key $1_test/client/client.key -cert $1_test/client/client.pem -connect localhost:4433 -CAfile $1_test/rootCA/demoCA/root.pem -new\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth group will be doing mutual authentication, the test result is shown here:\r\n\r\n- Group1:\r\n  5696 connections in **5.46s**; 1043.22 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  5696 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\n- Group2:\r\n  5652 connections in **23.03s**; 245.42 connections/user sec, bytes read 0\r\n  5652 connections in 31 real seconds, 0 bytes read per connection\r\n\r\nIf I looking at the total connection times I think it is correct. These two groups should have a similar performance. However, Group1 has much smaller user time than Group2 and I think that does not make sense. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if there is any error in my test so I just post my question here. If the user time measurement is indeed inaccurate, I wonder how should I change the code to make it correct.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot if anyone could help me!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/1081607363","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/363#issuecomment-1081607363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/363","id":1081607363,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA_fpb85AeATD","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-29T08:54:09Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T08:54:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for this report and analysis.
