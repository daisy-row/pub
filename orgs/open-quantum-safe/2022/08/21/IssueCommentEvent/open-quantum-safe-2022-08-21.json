To help us collect some more background to this suggestion: Did you (or are you aware of anyone that did) test interoperation between the OpenSSH-sntrup761 with https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh ? Does OpenSSH use `liboqs`?\r\n\r\nInterop between OpenSSH and OQS-OpenSSH on sntrup761 doesn't really make sense, because OQS-OpenSSH would include OpenSSH's sntrup761 suite without alteration.  As far as I know, OpenSSH natively includes an sntrup761 implementation, rather than using liboqs'.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1221586974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-21T17:20:33Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
