So, either we add such function (and then query it from a language wrapper as discussed) OR we document that \"wrapper and liboqs version may differ with unknown functional results in case of mismatch\". The latter I find personally unsatisfactory. The former would be trivial. Right now, the only way to query the liboqs version is by running the test programs that output the version string (and that would be the only way someone can detect such differences to explain possibly weird behaviours).\r\n\r\n@dstebila @vsoftco : Other suggestions?
