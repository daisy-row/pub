More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key exchange for TLS 1.3, and post-quantum and hybrid X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is release candidate 2 for version 0.7.2 of liboqs.\r\n\r\nSecurity considerations\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThis release removes Rainbow level 1 and all variants of SIDH and SIKE due to cryptanalytic breaks of those algorithms.  Users are advised to move away from use of those algorithms immediately.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.7.1 release of liboqs. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this release is to provide a final release for algorithms that were included in Round 3 of the NIST Post-Quantum Standardization project. As the security status of some algorithms changed during Round 3, it drops algorithms known to be broken as of release (Rainbow level 1, SIKE). Some algorithms also updated their specification during Round 3; version 0.7.2 does not incorporate any algorithm changes that result in different input/output behaviour compared to version 0.7.1; such changes will included in version 0.8.0.\r\n\r\nThe next release of liboqs, version 0.8.0, will remove some algorithms that did not advance beyond NIST Round 3, update implementations based on algorithm/specification revisions that happened during Round 3, and begin to incorporate Round 4 changes. Discussion of algorithms to be removed in version 0.8.0 can be found in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1245.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- Kyber: Update implementation and switch use of symmetric crypto to OQS common code\r\n- HQC: Fix build on gcc-12\r\n- SIKE: Remove SIKE due to break (https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975)\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Dilithium: Add ARMv8 optimized implementation and switch use of symmetric crypto to OQS common code\r\n- Picnic: Update implementation\r\n- Rainbow: Remove Rainbow level 1 due to break (https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214)\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Add support for building on powerpc64\r\n- Update XKCP implementation\r\n- Improve SHA2 implementation on ARMv8\r\n- Improve AES implementation on ARMv8\r\n- Add aarch64 CPU feature detection on FreeBSD\r\n- Improve cross-compiling on Windows\r\n- Enable integration of liboqs into other CMake-based projects\r\n- Increment shared object library version\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Update Picnic to 3.0.8 by @sebastinas in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1158\r\n*
