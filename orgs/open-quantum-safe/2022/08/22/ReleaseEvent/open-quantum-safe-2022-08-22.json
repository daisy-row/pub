More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**oqs-provider** is a standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)-based quantum-safe and hybrid key exchange for TLS 1.3, as well as quantum-safe and hybrid X.509 certificate generation, CMS ond dgst operations. \r\n\r\nWhen deployed, the `oqs-provider` binary (shared library) thus adds support for quantum-safe cryptographic operations to any standard OpenSSL(v3) installation.\r\n\r\nIn general, the oqs-provider `main` branch is meant to be useable in conjunction with the `main` branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and the `master` branch of [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).\r\n\r\nFurther details on building, testing and use can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.4.0 of oqs-provider.\r\n\r\nSecurity considerations\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThis release removes Rainbow level 1 and all variants of SIDH and SIKE due to cryptanalytic breaks of those algorithms.  Users are advised to move away from use of those algorithms immediately.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.3.0 release of oqs-provider and is fully tested to be used in conjunction with version 0.7.2 of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs). \r\n\r\noqs-provider has been integrated as an external test component for [OpenSSL3 testing](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/test/README-external.md#oqsprovider-test-suite) and will thus remain in line with any possibly required provider API enhancements.\r\n\r\n### Algorithm updates\r\n\r\n- Removal of SIKE/SIDH and Rainbow level I due to cryptographic breaks\r\n\r\n### Functional updates\r\n\r\n- Addition of quantum-safe CMS operations via the [OpenSSL interface](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-cms.html)\r\n- Addition of quantum-safe dgst operations via the [OpenSSL interface](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-dgst.html)\r\n\r\n### Misc updates\r\n\r\n- Additional testing\r\n- Integration with and of OpenSSL test harness\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0.\r\n","short_description_html":"<h1>oqs-provider 0.4.0</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
