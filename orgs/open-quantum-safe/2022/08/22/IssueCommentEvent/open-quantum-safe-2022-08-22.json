to clarify: my point was not about incorporation in OpenSSH itself because, as noted, recent versions of OpenSSH include the reference sntrup761 implementation and does not rely on liboqs to provide it. \r\n\r\nMy point is rather about the ecosystem of software that speaks SSH but does not leverage the OpenSSH codebase, particularly custom clients and servers -- in some of those cases, liboqs is the rational plug-in provider of pqcrypto implementations. Since various long-term stable linux distributions incorporate OpenSSH 8.9 (e.g. Ubuntu 22), even if OpenSSH moves to one of the NIST \"to be standardized\" algorithms, sntrup761 will remain in many cases as the only available pqcrypto choices for some time.\r\n\r\nWorst case software that relies on OpenSSH pqcrypto interop currently using liboqs can either just stick with an old version of liboqs or modified to directly use the reference implementation, but it seems wrong for a wonderful \"reference toolkit\" of options (i.e. liboqs) to not support it, at least until it is (mostly) phased out [I guess another way to \"depreciate\" that actually would mesh well with the timescales of LTSs would be to move the \"prune\" algorithms to \"included but not built by default\" in v0.8.x, and then removed in v.0.9.x]\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1223259073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-22T22:34:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
