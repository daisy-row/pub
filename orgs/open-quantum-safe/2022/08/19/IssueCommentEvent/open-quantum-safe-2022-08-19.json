It works really well!\r\n\r\nI do have one issue though...\r\n\r\nI have an example app that ships as part of the Rust crate that demonstrates the library in operation. The example connects to `test.openquantumsafe.org` on port `6051`. At the time of writing, this was the port used for the equivalent of `WOLFSSL_P521_KYBER_LEVEL5`. Since then though (I guess it was restarted?) the assigned port numbers have changed, so this example no longer works.\r\n\r\nI was wondering, is there a way to programmatically find the port for a given combo without having to parse the table  on https://test.openquantumsafe.org/ ?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1220920451","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1291#issuecomment-1220920451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1291","id":1220920451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5IxcSD","user":{"login":"expressvpn-pete-m","id":85149560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTQ5NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85149560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m","html_url":"https://github.com/expressvpn-pete-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/expressvpn-pete-m/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-19T17:31:11Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T17:31:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for taking the time to answer and apologies for somehow missing that on the test page!\r\n\r\nI'll add support to check for the correct port as part of the example application so that it will always find the correct one.
