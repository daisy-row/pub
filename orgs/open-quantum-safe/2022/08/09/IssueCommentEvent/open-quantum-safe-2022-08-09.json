I don't have any of those at my disposal to test. If you could confirm this, would you want to set `--ignore=tests/test_binary.py` when invoking `pytest`? Alternatively, can you propose \"carve-out\" statements that we could add to skip that test on those specific platforms?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1208981983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-09T06:50:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The one idea I could propose is that you play around with the env var DISPLAY; maybe explicitly set it to the _full-ip-address_:0 of your test VM. You might also want to log into the running container, `apt install x11-apps` and see whether you can start those, e.g., `xeyes`.
