More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.\r\n\r\n**OQS-libssh** is an integration of quantum-resistant algorithm from liboqs into (a fork of) libssh.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is the 2022-08 snapshot release of OQS-libssh, released on August 29, 2022.
