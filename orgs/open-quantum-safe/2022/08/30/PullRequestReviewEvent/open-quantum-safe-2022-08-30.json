For example:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint foo() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ntriggers the warning '-Wstrict-prototypes', because `foo` needs a prototype:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint foo(void) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nliboqs do have several functions without prototypes.

For example:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint foo() {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ntriggers the warning '-Wstrict-prototypes', because `foo` needs a prototype:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint foo(void) {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nliboqs do have several functions without prototypes. Since clang 15, it breaks\r\nthe compilation.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `void` parameter for functions without arguments.\r\n\r\nNote: this warning is not enabled by GCC.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
