Currently, the profiling results of the last x(=10) calendar days are collected and displayed and the last y(=5) calendar days are used to check for performance deviations. This logic would not properly handle days/dates without any profiling runs, i.e., with longer periodic bases.\r\n\r\nSuggestion is to retain the basic logic but permit arbitrary numbers of days without profiling runs. So, in future, the last x complete profiling runs (on all supported platforms, but on arbitrary dates in the past) are collected for presentation and the last y complete profiling runs are used to check performance deviation of any single new run.
