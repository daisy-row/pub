I need to build liboqs on Android to develop a command-line HTTPS client with post-quantum cryptography support. I followed all instructions for building on Linux (because Android is actually Linux distributive). But got a compiling error at `ninja` step.\r\nHere is what i did, and what I saw in terminal:\r\n\r\n0. I have used [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app?) as Linux-environment for Android.\r\n1. I have ran `apt install astyle cmake gcc ninja-build libssl-dev python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist unzip xsltproc doxygen graphviz python3-yaml valgrind`, output was: \r\n```\r\nChecking availability of current mirror: ok\r\n...\r\nE:  Unable to locate package astyle\r\nE:  Package gcc has no installation candidate, use libllvm instead\r\nE:  Package ninja-build has no installation candidate, use ninja instead\r\nE:  Package libssl-dev has no installation candidate, use openssl instead\r\nE:  Package python3-pytest has no installation candidate, use 'pip install pytest' instead\r\nE:  Package python3-pytest-xdist has no installation candidate, use 'pip install pytest-xdist' instead\r\nE:  Package python3-yaml has no installation candidate, use 'pip install pyYAML' instead\r\n```\r\nFinally, I have installed all these packages manually, except for `astyle, graphviz`. (I haven't found any ARM-versions of them).\r\nThis is what happened after:\r\n\r\n2. Did `git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git`. Output was OK.\r\n3. Did `cd liboqs && mkdir build && cd build`. OK too.\r\n4. Did `cmake -GNinja ..` Output was:\r\n```\r\n-- The C compiler identification is Clang 14.0.6\r\n-- The ASM compiler identification is Clang with GNU-like command-line\r\n-- Found assembler: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/cc\r\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info\r\n-- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done\r\n-- Check for working C compiler: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/cc - skipped\r\n-- Detecting C compile features\r\n-- Detecting C compile features - done\r\nCMake Warning at .CMake/compiler_opts.cmake:44 (message):\r\n  Setting OQS_OPT_TARGET=AUTO may not produce optimized code on this system.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:111 (include)\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Looking for pthread.h\r\n-- Looking for pthread.h - found\r\n-- Performing Test CMAKE_HAVE_LIBC_PTHREAD\r\n-- Performing Test CMAKE_HAVE_LIBC_PTHREAD - Failed\r\n-- Check if compiler accepts -pthread\r\n-- Check if compiler accepts -pthread - yes\r\n-- Found Threads: TRUE\r\n-- Found OpenSSL: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libcrypto.so (found suitable version \"3.0.3\", minimum required is \"1.1.1\")\r\n-- Found Doxygen: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/doxygen (found version \"1.9.4\") found components: doxygen missing components: dot\r\n-- Configuring done\r\n-- Generating done\r\n-- Build files have been written to: /data/data/com.termux/files/home/sys/liboqs/build\r\n```\r\nI think its okay, like previous.\r\n\r\n5. Bulding with `ninja`, error is here, while processing \"common.c.o\" by `ninja`.
