You can read up on the XMSS paramters on its [RFC page](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8391)\r\n\r\n> That depends on how they are triggered -- via .py files (using helpers.py)? If so, set the environment variable(s) SKIP_ALGS and/or SKIP_TESTS suitably.\r\n\r\nYes, the tests are triggered via .py files. The `test_cmdline.py` fie is supposed to call `test_sig_stfl_new_key`, `test_sig_stfl_read_key` (or) `test_sig_stfl_save_key`. Currently new_key and save_key are commented out because I want the CI tests to pass but I need to uncomment them somewhere down the line.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1215483235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-15T17:43:55Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
