This simplify some build\r\nconfiguration and make the CMake scripts more readable.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of functions this commit added:\r\n\r\n * oqs_define_architecture: simplify the detection of the processor and\r\n                            the way for adding a new supported architecture\r\n * oqs_test_c_flag: test a compiler flag on the current C compiler, if it is\r\n                    supported\r\n * oqs_add_c_flags: add flag(s) to a specific target, with some policies like\r\n                    REQUIRED/OPTIONAL and PUBLIC/PRIVATE\r\n * oqs_add_sanitizers: add a sanitizer option (address, leak, thread)\r\n                       The list of sanitizers is then applied using\r\n                       oqs_apply_sanitizers\r\n * oqs_add_ld_flags: add a linker flag with a chosen policy PUBLIC/PRIVATE\r\n\r\nFinally, some variables have been prefixed by OQS_ (like OQS_ARCH_)\r\n\r\n~* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)~\r\n~* [ ] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.)~\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1198747583","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1265#issuecomment-1198747583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1265","id":1198747583,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5Hc2-_","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T00:24:43Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T00:24:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> > Yes, I plan to update the CMakeLists.txt under the tests directory.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks in advance!\r\n> \r\n> > However, I am not sure if I can modify the CMakeLists.txts related to kem and sig namespaces (like /src/kem/bike/CMakeLists.txt), because those files seems to be imported.

Some of them (e.g., src/kem/kyber/CMakeLists.txt) however are generated using some code generators under `oqs_scripts`.  It's probably easiest for you if you make the changes in one or two of the `src/kem/*/CMakeLists.txt` and one or two of the `src/sig/*/CMakeLists.txt`, and then we can apply those to the code generator templates which should take care of the rest.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1198747583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-29T00:24:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

This simplify some build\r\nconfiguration and make the CMake scripts more readable.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of functions this commit added:\r\n\r\n * oqs_define_architecture: simplify the detection of the processor and\r\n                            the way for adding a new supported architecture\r\n * oqs_test_c_flag: test a compiler flag on the current C compiler, if it is\r\n                    supported\r\n * oqs_add_c_flags: add flag(s) to a specific target, with some policies like\r\n                    REQUIRED/OPTIONAL and PUBLIC/PRIVATE\r\n * oqs_add_sanitizers: add a sanitizer option (address, leak, thread)\r\n                       The list of sanitizers is then applied using\r\n                       oqs_apply_sanitizers\r\n * oqs_add_ld_flags: add a linker flag with a chosen policy PUBLIC/PRIVATE\r\n\r\nFinally, some variables have been prefixed by OQS_ (like OQS_ARCH_)\r\n\r\n~* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)~\r\n~* [ ] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.)~\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1199012001","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1265#issuecomment-1199012001","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1265","id":1199012001,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5Hd3ih","user":{"login":"thb-sb","id":108470890,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnciag","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108470890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb","html_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-29T08:24:50Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T08:24:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hello,\r\n\r\n> It is fine to edit any of the CMakeLists.txt files in this project, we aren't importing CMakeLists.txt from anywhere else.
