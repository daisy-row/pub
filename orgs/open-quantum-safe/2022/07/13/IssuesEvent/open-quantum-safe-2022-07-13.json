The same will not happen by using msbuild commands.\r\n\r\nAnother issue that I have is that by using the compiled library by the method which I said above I'm getting the following linking errors when I try to compile a simple test project (example_kem.c):\r\n- LNK2001\tunresolved external symbol __subborrow_u64\t\r\n- LNK2001\tunresolved external symbol __addcarry_u64\r\n- LNK2001\tunresolved external symbol __umul128\r\n- LNK2001\tunresolved external symbol ___shiftright128\r\n- LNK2001\tunresolved external symbol ___shiftleft128\r\n\r\nAll of the mentioned unresolved symbols are coming from oqs.lib.\r\n\r\nCompiling the same program with x64 configuration with the x64 static library works without issues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-13T14:04:03Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
