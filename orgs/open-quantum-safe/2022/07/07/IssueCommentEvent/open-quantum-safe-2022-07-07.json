So the goal for the resolution of this issue is to define and create a mechanism to build `liboqs` such as to differentiate at configure time (at least) between \"standardized\", \"round4\" and \"research\" algorithms, leading to different levels of (CI) testing and default inclusion in library builds. A final class comprises algorithms to be completely pruned. \r\n\r\nSo here's a first proposal:\r\n\r\n\"standard\": kyber, dilithium, falcon, sphincs\r\n\"round4\": bike, classic_mceliece, hqc, sike\r\n\"research\": frodo, ntru, picnic\r\nprune: rainbow, saber, ntruprime\r\n\r\nComments welcome. Regarding picnic, particularly by @christianpaquin; ntru as per the above (thanks, @jschanck) and frodo (thanks, @dstebila). Who could argue for the/a different classification of the \"prune\" candidates? Regarding ntruprime, what about touching base with the openssh community (whether they want to retain it regardless)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1177208298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-07T07:46:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
