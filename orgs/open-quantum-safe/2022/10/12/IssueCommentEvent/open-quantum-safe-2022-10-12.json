being inaccessible to providers, e.g., [this code](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/79edcf4da7d4525acf0db894bc6af6f9ca2b9b9b/crypto/cms/cms_lib.c#L412-L449) is failing when trying to feed it with MD \"NULL\". So back to my question above @opencrypto : How are you using/would you be testing this MD? CMS apparently won't accept it. What else would?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/1276444765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-12T16:29:13Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
