Three of the example demos that were provided with the original envoy source code have been modified to use the post-quantum implementation. They can be found in the examples folder in the source directory.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this work, I forked the OpenQuantumSafe implementation of BoringSSL, and updated the master-with-bazel branch to compile the latest BSSL code. This is stored [here](https://github.com/Post-Quantum-Mesh/boringssl).\r\n\r\nWe will be presenting this project, plus a post-quantum enabled istio build, at [KubeCon](https://kccncna2022.sched.com/event/182KF) on October 28th. As part of the presentation, we will be inviting the open-source community to continue work on the envoy and istio projects.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if it would be OK to submit a pull request for the boringssl fork to the bssl-oqs repo and the envoy demo to the oqs-demos repo, and do not hesitate to e-mail me with any questions or comments.\r\n\r\nThank you very much,\r\n\r\nDaniel Rouhana\r\ndanielrouhana@pm.me","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1297670897","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/156#issuecomment-1297670897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/156","id":1297670897,"node_id":"IC_kwDODP--n85NWOLx","user":{"login":"drouhana","id":56026339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDI2MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56026339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana","html_url":"https://github.com/drouhana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drouhana/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-31T20:52:01Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T20:52:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@baentsch Sorry for lagging on this, [PR](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/161) created!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1297670897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-31T20:52:01Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
