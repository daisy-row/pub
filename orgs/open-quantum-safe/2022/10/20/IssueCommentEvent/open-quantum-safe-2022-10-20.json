Conceptually oqsprovider has no dependencies that should make building on Windows impossible. Some test scripts may need to be adapted, though. The main \"difficulty\" is just that no-one with experience with that platform has taken a look yet and that no interest in running oqsprovider on Windows has been seriously voiced until now. All help/PRs would be very welcome.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1284946946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-20T05:19:36Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
