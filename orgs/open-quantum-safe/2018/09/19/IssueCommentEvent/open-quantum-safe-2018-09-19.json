are several problems with the recently merged KAT checks on master:\r\n\r\n1. Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Several of the Travis build logs are showing error messages despite passing.  So there are actually two problems to fix here: (a) figure out why there are KAT errors in the logs and fix them, and (b) figure out why the Travis tests aren't failing due to the errors.

are several problems with the recently merged KAT checks on master:\r\n\r\n1. Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

are several problems with the recently merged KAT checks on master:\r\n\r\n1. Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

are several problems with the recently merged KAT checks on master:\r\n\r\n1. Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Several of the Travis build logs are showing error messages despite passing.  So there are actually two problems to fix here: (a) figure out why there are KAT errors in the logs and fix them, and (b) figure out why the Travis tests aren't failing due to the errors.
