Maybe it's because I'm using vagrant, but when calling make without sudo, it fails to rename some files in the process with the message: \"permission denied\".

I will try to replicate the error and post again.\r\n\r\nOn another note, since you disabled symbolic linkage of the library file, does that mean we don't need to use -l when compiling anymore? Because the gcc linker can't find it anymore.\r\n\r\nCheers"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-09-06T21:44:18Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
