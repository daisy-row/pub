are several problems with the recently merged KAT checks on master:\r\n\r\n1. Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Several of the Travis build logs are showing error messages despite passing.  So there are actually two problems to fix here: (a) figure out why there are KAT errors in the logs and fix them, and (b) figure out why the Travis tests aren't failing due to the errors.
