I kind of think I'm missing something here, however I just want to use the library with mc_bits enabled, and that didn'T work as well, so I tried the standard build instead. Same problem.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-09-05T13:50:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Several of the Travis build logs are showing error messages despite passing.  So there are actually two problems to fix here: (a) figure out why there are KAT errors in the logs and fix them, and (b) figure out why the Travis tests aren't failing due to the errors.
