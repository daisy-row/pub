Building on macOS without OpenSSL yields the following error.  This is because rand\\_nist.c depends on OpenSSL, but we should be able to build liboqs master without OpenSSL.  So we need to selectively disable all relevant parts (rand\\_nist, kat\\_kem) when OpenSSL is not present.  Or we need to decide to require OpenSSL -- which would be something for discussion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrand_nist.c:12:10: fatal error: 'openssl/conf.h' file not found\r\n#include <openssl/conf.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

Refactor the build so rand\\_nist.c and kat\\_kem are not built when OpenSSL is not used.\r\n3. Add AES 256 without OpenSSL.\r\n\r\n3 seems like the proper choice -- and it will also allow us to build KATs on Windows.\r\n\r\nTo do 3, we need to:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement AES-256 in src/crypto/aes* => Douglas\r\n- [ ] Change rand\\_nist.c's `AES256_ECB` function to call OQS AES 256 and remove OpenSSL includes etc. in this file => Shravan\r\n- [ ] Remove `USE_OPENSSL` from around all randombytes\\_nist\\_kat and related stuff in src/common/rand.c => Shravan\r\n- [ ] See if that makes it build on macOS without OpenSSL enabled => Shravan\r\n- [ ] Add a Travis test for build on macOS without OpenSSL enabled => Shravan\r\n- [ ] Add rand\\_nist.c to VisualStudio build => Shravan, Christian\r\n- [ ] Add kat\\_kem to VisualStudio build => Christian\r\n- [ ] Add test script to AppVeyor that checks KATs => Christian"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-09-05T18:53:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
