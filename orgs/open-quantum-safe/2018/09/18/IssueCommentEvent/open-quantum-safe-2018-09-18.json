then looks like it's running configure again.  This configure is what's failing.  I'm not actually sure why it's running configure again, but it apparently is.  If you look in config.log, you'll see how it fails.  On my system here is the relevant extract from config.log:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin\r\nconfigure:3969: $? = 0\r\nconfigure:3958: clang -V >&5\r\nclang: error: argument to '-V' is missing (expected 1 value)\r\nclang: error: no input files\r\nconfigure:3969: $? = 1\r\nconfigure:3958: clang -qversion >&5\r\nclang: error: unknown argument: '-qversion'\r\nclang: error: no input files\r\nconfigure:3969: $? = 1\r\nconfigure:3989: checking whether the C compiler works\r\nconfigure:4011: clang   -static conftest.c  >&5\r\nld: library not found for -lcrt0.o\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\nconfigure:4015: $? = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key error message I think is \"library not found for -lcrt0.o\".  Googling this error message yields the following StackExchange discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3801011/ld-library-not-found-for-lcrt0-o-on-osx-10-6-with-gcc-clang-static-flag\r\n\r\nCan you investigate from there?"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-09-18T16:39:23Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
