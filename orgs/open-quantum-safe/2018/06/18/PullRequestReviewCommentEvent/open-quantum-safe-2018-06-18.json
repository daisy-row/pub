Currently, only Picnic L1FS is supported, as it is the only available sig alg in OQS's master.\r\n\r\nThe integration follows the patterns of ec/ecx_meth.c's ED25519 and ED448 algs; there is more modified code than the KEX integration, but the code should be simpler to review. The obj_dat.h and obj_mac.h are auto-generated by some make scripts (see README.md).\r\n\r\nI ran into an overflow problem with large Picnic cert; OpenSSL only allowed CertificateVerify messages of size 2^14, while the TLS 1.3 spec defined them with a max of 2^16 + 2. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6433) on OpenSSL to ask about this and they confirmed this limit is artificially low to accommodate currently-supported sigs; I modified statem_[clnt/srvr].c to support larger PQC

Currently, only Picnic L1FS is supported, as it is the only available sig alg in OQS's master.\r\n\r\nThe integration follows the patterns of ec/ecx_meth.c's ED25519 and ED448 algs; there is more modified code than the KEX integration, but the code should be simpler to review. The obj_dat.h and obj_mac.h are auto-generated by some make scripts (see README.md).\r\n\r\nI ran into an overflow problem with large Picnic cert; OpenSSL only allowed CertificateVerify messages of size 2^14, while the TLS 1.3 spec defined them with a max of 2^16 + 2. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6433) on OpenSSL to ask about this and they confirmed this limit is artificially low to accommodate currently-supported sigs; I modified

The obj_dat.h and obj_mac.h are auto-generated by some make scripts (see README.md).\r\n\r\nI ran into an overflow problem with large Picnic cert; OpenSSL only allowed CertificateVerify messages of size 2^14, while the TLS 1.3 spec defined them with a max of 2^16 + 2. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6433) on OpenSSL to ask about this and they confirmed this limit is artificially low to accommodate currently-supported sigs; I modified
