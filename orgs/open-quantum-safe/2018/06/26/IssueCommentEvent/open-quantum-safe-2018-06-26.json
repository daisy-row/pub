These sizes are to be set when an instance of the signature algorithm is created via a call to `OQS_new`, and are then used to allocate sufficient memory for keys before calling the algorithm's keygen method. However, some QS signature schemes have varying key sizes (e.g. NIST candidate [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/), which features optional compression for private keys).\r\n\r\nConsidering this, it could be better to let the algorithm's keygen method modify the key size fields appropriately. This would also require adding a `max_key_len` field to `OQS_SIG` so as to enable the caller to allocate memory before the keygen method is called."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/400394007","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/297#issuecomment-400394007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/297","id":400394007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMDM5NDAwNw==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-26T17:15:29Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T17:15:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi Maxime!
