Currently, only Picnic L1FS is supported, as it is the only available sig alg in OQS's master.\r\n\r\nThe integration follows the patterns of ec/ecx_meth.c's ED25519 and ED448 algs; there is more modified code than the KEX integration, but the code should be simpler to review. The obj_dat.h and obj_mac.h are auto-generated by some make scripts (see README.md).\r\n\r\nI ran into an overflow problem with large Picnic cert; OpenSSL only allowed CertificateVerify messages of size 2^14, while the TLS 1.3 spec defined them with a max of 2^16 + 2. I opened an [issue](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/6433) on OpenSSL to ask about this and they confirmed this limit is artificially low to accommodate currently-supported sigs; I modified statem_[clnt/srvr].c to support larger PQC sigs.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/398895741","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/31#issuecomment-398895741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/31","id":398895741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODg5NTc0MQ==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T21:02:13Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T21:02:13Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"OK, I pushed a commit that should fix the issue.
