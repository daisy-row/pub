This branch of liboqs focuses on selected key encapsulations and signature algorithms.\n \n Overview\n --------\n \n The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.\n \n-**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs initially focuses on key exchange algorithms.  liboqs provides a common API suitable for post-quantum key exchange algorithms, and will collect together various implementations.  liboqs will also include a test harness and benchmarking routines to compare performance of post-quantum implementations.\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs provides:\n \n-OQS will also include integrations into application-level protocols to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  Our first integration is in OpenSSL:\n+- a common API for post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signature schemes\n+- a collection of open source implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms\n+- a test harness and benchmarking routines\n \n-- **open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into OpenSSL 1.0.2.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".  See more about this integration in its GitHub repository [open-quantum-safe/openssl/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/).\n+The OQS project also provides prototype integrations into application-level protocols to enable testing of quantum-resistant cryptography.  \n \n More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n \n-Contents\n---------\n-\n-liboqs currently contains:\n-\n-- `kex_rlwe_newhope`: \"NewHope\": key exchange from the ring learning with

This branch of liboqs focuses on selected key encapsulations and signature algorithms.\n \n Overview\n --------\n \n The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.\n \n-**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs initially focuses on key exchange algorithms.  liboqs provides a common API suitable for post-quantum key exchange algorithms, and will collect together various implementations.  liboqs will also include a test harness and benchmarking routines to compare performance of post-quantum implementations.\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  liboqs provides:\n \n-OQS will also include integrations into application-level protocols to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  Our first integration is in OpenSSL:\n+- a common API for post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signature schemes\n+- a collection of open source implementations of post-quantum cryptography algorithms\n+- a test harness and benchmarking routines\n \n-- **open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into OpenSSL 1.0.2.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".  See more about this integration in its GitHub repository [open-quantum-safe/openssl/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/).\n+The OQS project also provides prototype integrations into application-level protocols to enable testing of quantum-resistant cryptography.  \n \n More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n \n-Contents\n---------\n-\n-liboqs currently contains:\n-\n-- `kex_rlwe_newhope`: \"NewHope\": key exchange from the ring learning with errors problem (Alkim, Ducas, Pöppelmann, Schwabe, *USENIX Security 2016*, [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1092](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1092)) (using the reference C implementation of NewHope from [https://github.com/tpoeppelmann/newhope](https://github.com/tpoeppelmann/newhope))\n-- `kex_sidh_msr`: key exchange from the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman problem (Costello, Naehrig, Longa, *CRYPTO 2016*, [https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/413](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/413)), using the implementation of Microsoft Research [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sidh-library/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/sidh-library/)\n-- `kex_code_mcbits`: \"McBits\": key exchange from the error correcting codes, specifically Niederreiter's form of McEliece public key encryption using hidden Goppa codes (Bernstein, Chou, Schwabe, *CHES 2013*, [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/610](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/610)), using the implementation of McBits from [https://www.win.tue.nl/~tchou/mcbits/](https://www.win.tue.nl/~tchou/mcbits/))\n-- `kex_ntru`: NTRU: key transport using NTRU public key encryption (Hoffstein, Pipher, Silverman, *ANTS 1998*) with the EES743EP1 parameter set, wrapper around the implementation from the NTRU Open Source project [https://github.com/NTRUOpenSourceProject/NTRUEncrypt](https://github.com/NTRUOpenSourceProject/NTRUEncrypt))\n-- `sig_picnic`: signature based on zero-knowledge proof as specified in Post-Quantum Zero-Knowledge and Signatures from Symmetric-Key Primitives (Melissa Chase and David Derler and Steven Goldfeder and Claudio Orlandi and Sebastian Ramacher and Christian Rechberger and Daniel Slamanig and Greg Zaverucha, [https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/279.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/279.pdf)), using the optimized implemenation from [https://github.com/IAIK/Picnic](https://github.com/IAIK/Picnic)\n-- `sig_qtesla`: signature based on the hardness of the decisional Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem, as described in the [qTesla specification](https://qtesla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/qTESLA_v2.1_06.30.2018.pdf), using the code from [https://github.com/qtesla/qTesla](https://github.com/qtesla/qTesla)\n-\n-Detailed information about each algorithm and implementations can be found in the [docs/Algorithm data sheets](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master/docs/Algorithm%20data%20sheets) directory.\n+master branch\n+-------------\n \n-Building and Running on Linux and macOS\n----------------------------------------\n+This branch of liboqs aims to selectively incorporate potentially quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms and signature schemes, for the purposes of integration into a common API for liboqs-reliant applications.","path":"README.md","position":47,"original_position":47,"commit_id":"18eaf91c067c2ccbfa35e754ad6d59baad355923","original_commit_id":"18eaf91c067c2ccbfa35e754ad6d59baad355923","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":" \"potentially\" quantum-resistant sounds doubtful; is \"potentially\" that needed?
