Assuming sequential means that if we want to remove an algorithm, we can't have gaps. So we'd have to reassign numbers.  But then this would mean binary incompatibility between different versions of liboqs nist-branch.  We also could not have binary compatibility with liboqs master (once master gets the new KEM API) because a different order of KEMs.  So I am trying strings for algorithm identifiers."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/378314455","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/257#issuecomment-378314455","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/257","id":378314455,"user":{"login":"vsoftco","id":6188943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6188943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco","html_url":"https://github.com/vsoftco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-03T16:37:07Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T16:37:07Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Code is OK after all, tricky thing with the string.
