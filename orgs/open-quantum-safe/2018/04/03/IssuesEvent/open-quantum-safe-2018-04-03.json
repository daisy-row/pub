For each Frodo target, we use the underlying Makefile rather than trying to build it directly.  That Makefile builds in place.  But there are 4 Frodo targets, so make -j4 tries to do each of those in parallel, and they end up messing each other up.  So we'll have to find some way to force those 4 targets to go sequentially. \r\n\r\nThis ticket is to formally track progress on the issue."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-04-03T20:44:57Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
