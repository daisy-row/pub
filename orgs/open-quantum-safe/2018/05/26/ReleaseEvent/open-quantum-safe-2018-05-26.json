More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  \r\n\r\n**open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) OpenSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nThis branch of our fork of OpenSSL aims to provide integration of post-quantum algorithms from liboqs into OpenSSL 1.0.2.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis snapshot of the OQS fork of OpenSSL 1.0.2 (`OQS-OpenSSL-1_0_2-stable`) was released on May 30, 2018.  Its release page on Github is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/releases/tag/OQS-OpenSSL-1_0_2-stable-snapshot-2018-05.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the second snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable.\r\n\r\nIt includes all upstream changes to OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable since the last snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable.  There are no additional changes.\r\n\r\nComparison to OQS' other OpenSSL branches\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nModifications to OpenSSL also exist on our fork's OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable branch.  This snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable (\"OQS-102\") contains the following differences compared to our OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable (\"102\") branch:\r\n\r\n- \"OQS-102\" uses the new key encapsulation mechanism API available in the liboqs nist-branch, and which will be coming to liboqs master branch by May 2018.  \"102\" uses the key exchange API available in earlier liboqs development.\r\n- \"102\" includes support for liboqs-based signature schemes.  \"OQS-102\" does not at present, since the current release of liboqs nist-branch does not contain signatures.  We aim to change this by June 2018.\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSnapshot releases of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable will be made bi-monthly.  These will include syncing the branch with upstream modifications made in the original OpenSSL repository, and syncing with new releases of liboqs.  snapshot releases in intermittent months may be made when merited.\r\n\r\nBy June 2018, we intend to have OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable building against both liboqs nist-branch and liboqs master branch, and including support for liboqs-based signature schemes.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-05-26T22:02:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
