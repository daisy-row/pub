More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  \r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs (**nist-branch**) focuses on incorporating submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project.  Details about nist-branch can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/nist-branch/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- OpenSSL 1.0.2: A prototype integration of liboqs-based key exchange into TLS 1.2 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.0.2; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1_0_2-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis snapshot of nist-branch was released on May 30, 2018.  Its release page on Github is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/nist-branch-snapshot-2018-05.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the second snapshot release of liboqs nist-branch.\r\n\r\n### New key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\nThe following KEMs have been added in the 2018-05 snapshot release:\r\n\r\n- **BIG QUAKE**: 3 parameterization: BIG_QUAKE_1, BIG_QUAKE_3, BIG_QUAKE_5 (contributed by Shravan Mashra (University of Waterloo))\r\n- **BIKE**: 9 parameterizations: BIKE1-L1, BIKE1-L3, BIKE1-L5, BIKE2-L1, BIKE2-L3, BIKE2-L5, BIKE3-L1, BIKE3-L3, BIKE3-L5; optimized builds on Linux platforms with AVX/AVX2/AVX512 support (contributed by Nir Drucker and Shay Gueron (Amazon Web Services))\r\n- **LIMA**: 6 parameterizations: Lima-2p-1024-CCA-KEM, Lima-2p-2048-CCA-KEM, Lima-sp-1018-CCA-KEM, Lima-sp-1306-CCA-KEM, Lima-sp-1822-CCA-KEM, Lima-sp-2062-CCA-KEM (contributed by Douglas Stebila (McMaster University))\r\n- **Saber**: 3 parameterizations: LightSaber-KEM, Saber-KEM, FireSaber-KEM (contributed by Douglas Stebila (McMaster University))\r\n- **SIKE**: 2 parameterizations: Sike-p503, Sike-p751 (contributed by Christian Paquin (Microsoft Research))\r\n\r\n### General improvements\r\n\r\n- Can now be built with multi-threaded make (e.g., `make -j8`)\r\n- The default pseudorandom number generator is now OpenSSL's `RAND_bytes` function for better performance; applications can choose a different PRNG at runtime\r\n- `example_kem` matches documented example in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Minimal-example-of-a-post-quantum-key-encapsulation-mechanism-(using-the-new-NIST-like)-API (contributed by Vlad Gheorghiu)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed improperly built shared library\r\n- Cleansed secret variables in example programs\r\n\r\nComparison to liboqs master\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nThis snapshot release of nist-branch contains the following differences compared to the current version of liboqs master:\r\n\r\n- Algorithms are formulated as key encapsulation mechanisms, rather than key exchange mechanisms.\r\n- Integrations are \"light touch\" -- see README.md for more about integration philosophy.\r\n- A different build process is used.\r\n- A global `randombytes` function is available for random number generation, rather than the `OQS_RAND` object in master.\r\n- Signature schemes are not yet supported.\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSnapshot releases of nist-branch will be made monthly.  Plans for the next snapshot release of nist-branch can be found online at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/8.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June 2018, we aim to release a new version of our master branch that uses the same API as nist-branch.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-05-31T02:12:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  \r\n\r\n**open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) OpenSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nThis branch of our fork of OpenSSL aims to provide integration of post-quantum algorithms from liboqs into OpenSSL 1.0.2.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis snapshot of the OQS fork of OpenSSL 1.0.2 (`OQS-OpenSSL-1_0_2-stable`) was released on May 30, 2018.  Its release page on Github is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/releases/tag/OQS-OpenSSL-1_0_2-stable-snapshot-2018-05.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the second snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable.\r\n\r\nIt includes all upstream changes to OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable since the last snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable.  There are no additional changes.\r\n\r\nComparison to OQS' other OpenSSL branches\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nModifications to OpenSSL also exist on our fork's OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable branch.  This snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable (\"OQS-102\") contains the following differences compared to our OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable (\"102\") branch:\r\n\r\n- \"OQS-102\" uses the new key encapsulation mechanism API available in the liboqs nist-branch, and which will be coming to liboqs master branch by May 2018.  \"102\" uses the key exchange API available in earlier liboqs development.\r\n- \"102\" includes support for liboqs-based signature schemes.  \"OQS-102\" does not at present, since the current release of liboqs nist-branch does not contain signatures.  We aim to change this by June 2018.\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSnapshot releases of OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable will be made bi-monthly.  These will include syncing the branch with upstream modifications made in the original OpenSSL repository, and syncing with new releases of liboqs.  snapshot releases in intermittent months may be made when merited.\r\n\r\nBy June 2018, we intend to have OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable building against both liboqs nist-branch and liboqs master branch, and including support for liboqs-based signature schemes.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-05-31T02:15:01Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
