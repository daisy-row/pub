(I ran into this bug when trying to build our OpenSSL 1.1.1 against our liboqs master (with OpenSSL enabled) on macOS; in particular the OPENSSLDIR macro ends up conflicting and causing build failures.)\r\n\r\nWe use config.h in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. To export various configuration information about liboqs, such as what version of liboqs it is and which KEMs/SIGs were enabled.\r\n2. Within liboqs to know if various build options are available, such as USE_AES_NI.\r\n\r\nWe should separate these two functionalities.  One file should contain the exported liboqs configuration options and this should be part of the installed public headers.  The other file should contain the raw output from ./configure, and not be installed as part of the public headers.\r\n\r\nMy solution is to create a distinct oqsconfig.h which contains just the liboqs configuration macros, which is part of the exported headers.  On nist-branch, this will be generated by make.  On master branch, this will be generated by grepping ./configure's config.h for all lines with `OQS_` in them.\r\n\r\nVarious calling files have to change in order to work correctly with this, including:\r\n\r\n- calling applications should only `#include <oqs/oqs.h>` which then includes the relevant oqsconfig.h file\r\n- code within liboqs that needs to know about macros detected by ./configure has to explicitly `#include \"../../config.h\"` (for however many levels of `..` it takes to refer to the root of the liboqs directory tree)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-31T22:09:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
