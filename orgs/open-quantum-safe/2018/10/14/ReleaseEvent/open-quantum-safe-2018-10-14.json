More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  \r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs (**master branch**) aims to selectively incorporate allegedly quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms and signature schemes, for the purposes of integration into a common API for liboqs-reliant applications.  Details about liboqs master branch can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use and acceptance criteria.\r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- OpenSSL 1.1.1: A prototype integration of liboqs-based key exchange and authentication into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- OpenSSH 7.7 portable 1: A prototype integration of liboqs-based key exchange into SSH in our fork of OpenSSH 7.7; see the [OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master) branch of our OpenSSH fork's repository.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\n**This is a release candidate for liboqs master, not a final release.**. This release of liboqs master branch was released on TODO.  Its release page on GitHub is TODO.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the first release of liboqs master branch.\r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs aims to selectively incorporate allegedly quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms and signature schemes, for the purposes of integration into a common API for liboqs-reliant applications.  Implementations on this branch must meet certain acceptance criteria as indicated in README.md.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\nThe following KEMs are present in this liboqs master release:\r\n\r\n- **BIKE**, based on quasi-cyclic syndrome decoding; 9 parameterizations: `BIKE1-L1`, `BIKE1-L3`, `BIKE1-L5`, `BIKE2-L1`, `BIKE2-L3`, `BIKE2-L5`, `BIKE3-L1`, `BIKE3-L3`, `BIKE3-L5`\r\n- **FrodoKEM**, based on learning with errors; 4 parameterizations: `FrodoKEM-640-AES`, `FrodoKEM-640-cSHAKE`, `FrodoKEM-976-AES`, `FrodoKEM-976-cSHAKE`\r\n- **NewHopeNIST**, based on ring learning with errors; 2 parameterizations: `NewHope-512-CCA-KEM`, `NewHope-1024-CCA-KEM`\r\n- **SIKE** and **SIDH**, based on the supersingular isogeny walk problem; 4 parameterizations: `Sike-p503`, `Sike-p751`, `Sidh-p503`, `Sidh-p751`\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\nThe following signature schemes are present in this liboqs master release:\r\n\r\n- **Picnic**: based on hash function and key recovery security of lowMC block cipher; 6 parameterizations: `picnic_L1_FS`, `picnic_L1_UR`, `picnic_L3_FS`, `picnic_L3_UR`, `picnic_L5_FS`, `picnic_L5_UR`\r\n- **qTESLA**, based on ring learning with errors; 3 parameterizations: `qTESLA_I`, `qTESLA_III_size`, `qTESLA_III_speed`\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nReleases of liboqs master branch will be made every 2 to 3 months.  Details about the algorithm lifecycle of master branch can be found in README.md.  Plans for the next release can be found online at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/12."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-14T19:35:25Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
