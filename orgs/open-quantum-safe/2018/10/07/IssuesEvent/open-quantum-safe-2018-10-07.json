AES and SSE2 gcc flags are included\r\n`gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-maes’; did you mean ‘-mapcs’?`\r\n`gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-msse2’`\r\nAlmost all makefiles return this error when running make.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The architecture is not recognized (I think), giving unsupported architecture warnings when building.\r\n`config.h:52:2: error: #error -- \"Unsupported ARCHITECTURE\"`\r\n` #error-- \"Unsupported ARCHITECTURE\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Quick fixes\r\n- For 1:\r\nRemoving all AES and SSE2 flags on all Makefiles:\r\n`for file in $(find . -name Makefile); do sed -i -e 's/-maes -msse2//g' $file; done`\r\n\r\n- For 2:\r\nRemoving the `#else` clause in the preprocessor, in `src/kem/frodokem/config.h`:\r\n`sed -i -z 's/#else\\n#error-- \"Unsupported ARCHITECTURE\"//g' src/kem/frodokem/config.h`\r\n\r\nApplying both quick fixes above results in a successful build. Have not tested further.\r\n\r\nAm I missing some steps or forgetting to set environment variables to properly configure the build?"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-07T22:18:17Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
