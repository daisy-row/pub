Specifically, the function BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) changed its behavior (changes from May 2018). \r\n\r\nThe detailed explanation: \r\n(if you wish to skip the details scroll down to the solution) \r\n1.\tRecall that the problem occurs in BIKE2. BIKE2 differs from BIKE1 and BIKE 3 in the following: BIKE2 achieves a shorter public key at the expense of polynomial inversion. \r\n2.\tInversion is taken modulo x^r+1 for a prime r such that (x^r+1)/(x+1) is irreducible (arithmetic over GF[2]). \r\n3.\tIn this polynomial ring, a polynomial is invertible if and only if its weight (= the number of nonzero coefficients) is odd. For example (x^2+x+1) * (x^4+x^2+x) = 1 mod x^5+1, so (x^2+x+1) is invertible (with weight 3) and (x+1) is not invertible. \r\n4.\tBN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) presumably computes a^(-1) mod p for polynomials a, b and returns an error when no such inverse exists (or found). It used to do the computations with GCD, but changed, in version 1.1.0, to run some trick in order to be (semi) constant time. Now it does the following: 1) choose a random b; 2) compute c = a*b; 3) invert c); 4) multiply by b. \r\n5.\tUnfortunately, this does not work in the general case, where p is not necessarily irreducible. In fact, for the case of BIKE2, multiplying an “a” (odd weight) by a random b, might flip the parity of the weight of the product a*b (it happens when the weight of b is even, and this is ~50% of the times). Thus, a definitely invertible input (a) can be turned into a non-invertible polynomial (a*b) and the “new” function BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) returns an error. \r\n6.\tThis does not seem to be a legitimate behavior of BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p), because, e.g., feeding the polynomial “1” and p = x^5+1 should return “1” but instead, it will now return an error 50% of the time. Also, it is not clear what “error” means: is it “no inverse exists” (which is false) or “the new functionality failed” (and then why)? \r\nIt could be argued that BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) is meant to receive only irreducible p’s. Still, we expected the “BN” features of OpenSSL to be “dependable”, which turned out not to be the case for our case. That is, inverting modulo x^r+1 should work when there exists an inverse (as it did in OpenSSL ver. 1.0.1).\r\n7.\tPerhaps it would have been more prudent to leave BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) unchanged, and add a new function BN_GF2m_mod_inv_irreducible(a, p)with the new (constant time) behavior. Or, at least clearly document the functionality and assumption of BN_GF2m_mod_inv. We will inform OpenSSL developers and let them decide what to do with this. \r\n8.\tThis analysis explains why the problem appeared “suddenly” (Linux default might still use OpenSSL 1.0.2 and OQS was tested on this version; the 1.1.0 OepnSSL version changed this…), why BIKE2, and why we see the “50%” failures. \r\n9.\tAs a demonstration this snippet will invert x^2+x+1 modulo x^5+1 on 1.0.2, but fail with significant probability on 1.1.0\r\n\r\n#include \"stdio.h\"\r\n#include \"openssl/bn.h\"\r\n\r\nvoid main()\r\n{\r\nBIGNUM *a, *m, *r;\r\na = BN_new();\r\nr = BN_new();\r\nm = BN_new();\r\nBN_CTX *bn_ctx = BN_CTX_new();\r\nBN_hex2bn(&m, \"21\"); \r\n\r\nBN_hex2bn(&a, \"1\");\r\n\r\nprintf(\"hhh %d\\n\",BN_GF2m_mod_inv(r, a, m, bn_ctx));\r\nprintf(\"m: %s\\n\", BN_bn2hex(m));\r\nprintf(\"a: %s\\n\", BN_bn2hex(a)); \r\nreturn;\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat to do now? \r\nWe added a quick fix, and will commit it soon. Basically, \r\n1. Call BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) \r\n2. Check the error status (with an “if” statement). \r\n3. If \"error\" is returned, call BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) again.\r\n4. Continue until the inverse is (successfully) computed. \r\n\r\nThe expected number of times until it succeeds is 2, i.e., we do not expect noticeable timing impact here. Also, we do not care about timing (due to the \"if\" statements) nor about exposing the number of attempts, because this is a property of the randomized b, thus does not reveal anything confidential. \r\n\r\nIn the long run, it might be neater to factor x^r+1 = (x+1) * ( x^{r-1} + x^{r-2} + … + x + 1) where the latter polynomial is irreducible. Then use the new BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) function with that polynomial, and subsequently use the CRT. Alternatively, we could simply write the inversion directly and BN_GF2m_mod_inv(a, p) altogether. \r\n\r\nFor now, the quick fix is fine. \r\n\r\nNir and Shay\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-26T15:42:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

turned Travis on for this repository.\r\n\r\n@smashra and I were discussing whether/how to trigger OpenSSL/OpenSSH integration tests when just a liboqs commit is made.  I noticed in the Travis settings it's possible to set a cron job to regularly build a repository.  But also we might want to add Travis target(s) in each of the liboqs master and nist .travis.yml files that runs the integration test script(s)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-26T19:48:37Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
