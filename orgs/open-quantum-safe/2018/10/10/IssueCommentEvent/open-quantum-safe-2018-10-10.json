adds an `alg_version` field to the `OQS_KEM` and `OQS_SIG` objects.  The intention for this field is as described in README.md:\r\n\r\n> **Algorithm compatibility:** Unlike existing standardization cryptographic algorithms (SHA-2, SHA-3, PKCS\\#1v1.5, nistp256, ...), post-quantum algorithms are under active development, and the mathematical algorithm of a cryptographic scheme may change: a particular name (e.g., \"FrodoKEM-AES-640\") may refer to different mathematical algorithms over time.  liboqs may update implementations as algorithms evolve.  Using our semantic versioning, versions with the same first two components ($X.Y.*$) will be interoperable.  But version $X.Y.Z$ and version $X.(Y+1).Z'$ may not be interoperable.  liboqs-reliant applications can check the `alg_version` member of the `OQS_KEM` data structure for each algorithm to obtain an identifier of the algorithm version used in a particular implementation; implementations returning the same `alg_version` for an algorithm will be interoperable.\r\n\r\nThis version is also recorded in the corresponding algorithm datasheet.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, a GitHub commit URL will serve as the version identifier for a particular algorithm."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/428635742","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/411#issuecomment-428635742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/411","id":428635742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODYzNTc0Mg==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-10T16:16:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T16:16:22Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I updated the version for qtesla and picnic"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-10T16:16:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The intention for this field is as described in README.md:\r\n\r\n> **Algorithm compatibility:** Unlike existing standardization cryptographic algorithms (SHA-2, SHA-3, PKCS\\#1v1.5, nistp256, ...), post-quantum algorithms are under active development, and the mathematical algorithm of a cryptographic scheme may change: a particular name (e.g., \"FrodoKEM-AES-640\") may refer to different mathematical algorithms over time.  liboqs may update implementations as algorithms evolve.  Using our semantic versioning, versions with the same first two components ($X.Y.*$) will be interoperable.  But version $X.Y.Z$ and version $X.(Y+1).Z'$ may not be interoperable.  liboqs-reliant applications can check the `alg_version` member of the `OQS_KEM` data structure for each algorithm to obtain an identifier of the algorithm version used in a particular implementation; implementations returning the same `alg_version` for an algorithm will be interoperable.\r\n\r\nThis version is also recorded in the corresponding algorithm datasheet.\r\n\r\nWhere possible, a GitHub commit URL will serve as the version identifier for a particular algorithm."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/428762503","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/411#issuecomment-428762503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/411","id":428762503,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODc2MjUwMw==","user":{"login":"smashra","id":14256579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjU2NTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14256579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra","html_url":"https://github.com/smashra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashra/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-10T23:04:55Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T23:04:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I think we still want to maintain the existing semantics of semantic\nversioning.\n\nBecause the way we are doing is hacking semantic versioning to accommodate\nalgorithm versioning.\n\nProbably we should augment the scheme to introduce algorithm version such\nthat semantic versioning works as such.\n\nFor e.g.\n\nX.Y.Z.A\n\nX - algorithm version number\nThe rest is the default semantic versioning.\nOnce every thing stabilized we discard X and still be semantic version\ncompatible.\n\nOn Wed, Oct 10, 2018 at 6:39 PM Douglas Stebila <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> The way I understand semantic version is that 1.Y.Z and 1.A.B should be\n> *binary* compatible, meaning they have the same binary API.
