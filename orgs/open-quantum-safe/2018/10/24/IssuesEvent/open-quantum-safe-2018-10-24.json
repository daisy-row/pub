Since the openssl project already has it's own code, it would be good split the script in subcomponents, for example: build-liboqs-master, build-liboqs-nist, build-openssl-1.0.2, build-openssl-1.1.1, run-openssl-1.0.2-tests, and run-openssl-1.1.1-tests. This way the openssl travis test could skip the build-openssl-* subscripts, and reuse the code to build liboqs and run the openssl tests.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-24T17:57:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
