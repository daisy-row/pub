This will help in debug/reproduce the error later. This also follows the model exists in other open source projects such as:\r\n1) OpenSSL (https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/include/openssl/ecerr.h) and \r\n2) OpenSSH (https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/7d68e262944c1fff1574600fe0e5e92ec8b398f5/ssherr.h),\r\nwhere the developers can find, for example, errors regarding the internals of an EC protocol. In addition, this model was the one we agreed on in one of the previous OQS meetings.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think like you that a change is needed here. In my opinion we should follow the model in OpenSSL/BoringSSL where the last error is reported (set) globally. Here, the developer only gets the vague OQS_FAILURE (ERROR) message, but he can query the relevant OQS (error) API in order to get the exact error. \r\n\r\nNote that one of the reasons that originally led to the current paradigm is that it was simpler. Handling errors in the global space require the mechanism to be thread-safe. Such a mechanism wasn't available at the time of adding BIKE. \r\n\r\nTo summarize: in my opinion the solution for this issue should be:\r\n  1) Adding a thread-safe error (global) mechanism and API.\r\n  2) Adapting the KEM/SIG protocols to use this APIs.\r\n  3) Converting OQS_STATUS to only have OQS_SUCCESS/ OQS_FAILURE/ OQS_ERROR.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-10-20T15:33:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
