This is not the usual C convention, where 0 is used for success. Moreover, all over the code, there are hard-coded `return 1;` or `return 0;` instead of using the corresponding macros. I propose to change it, and have `#define OQS_SUCCESS 0` and `#define OQS_ERROR -1`, and perhaps a `typedef OQS_STATUS int` or something similar, so it's clear from the function signature whether it returns any `int` or a status code. Also we should change all hard-coded `return 1;` or `return 0;` with corresponding `return OQS_SUCCESS/OQS_ERROR`, respectively.
