I made a standalone version using the pq-crystals implementation as a base, and integrated your random provider and sha3, and it's working fine now. As to the current problem, I believe it is in polyvec.c . \r\nCompare your version with that one: https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/blob/master/ref/polyvec.c\r\nYou will notice that the KYBER_K constant which sets the outer bound for loops in various functions in that class, has been replaced with the KYDER_D constant. This should work properly if D=K=3, but in your implementation, K=4 ('paranoid mode'), which causes the polynomials to be under-processed.\r\nThere are a number of other changes that I am unsure of (cbd, poly_getnoise, gen_matrix..), enough that I felt it was better to begin again, using that version as a starting point.\r\nI'll create a new project (Misc C) tomorrow, use it house the sha3 and the Kyber implementation.\r\nI still have to go over it thoroughly (another 'tune-up'), and make it a drop-in replacement, but I should have this done by Sunday.\r\nI plan to add the cSHAKE change (but working this time ;) because it is actually an improvement to the original.
