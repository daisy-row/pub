An incrementing domain code is used to initialize Keccak's state to unique values inside the inner loop, and a different domain code should yield a completely different output from SHAKE, even with the same seed, but in this case, the coefficient arrays produced are all identical. \r\nI have traced this to the (sha3.c) OQS_SHA3_cshake128_simple_absorb function. That function adds the domain code to the first state member, transforms the state, and then calls the keccak_absorb function, passing in the modified state.

Thanks for the code.  I've started to incorporate the code from your project into our directory under pull request #202.\r\n\r\nIn your sha3_test file, there were several build failures because some of your calls to OQS_SHA3_shake256_squeezeblocks (and similar functions) were being given 4 arguments when they should only take 3.  I've fixed in the copy I made in PR #202.\r\n\r\nIs your sha3_test.h also under public domain like sha3.c?\r\n\r\nIn your email to me you also commented about how cSHAKE with N=\"\" and S=\"\" doesn't produce the same output as the standard (SP800-185 3.2).  This seems like a problem to me, and something we should fix.  But I wasn't sure from your email if you thought it was okay to leave as is.  Can you explain more?\r\n\r\nDouglas"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-01-02T19:23:25Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
