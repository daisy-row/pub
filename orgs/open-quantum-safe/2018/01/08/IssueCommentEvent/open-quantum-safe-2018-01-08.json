Removed unused headers, added missing brackets and braces.. all fixed now.\r\nAlso, I got the cSHAKE option implemented, it can be turned on or off via a def in params.h (reverts to SHAKE).\r\n\r\nI'll use this as a starting point for my C++ implementation, and now there is a version out there that works in Visual Studio..\r\n\r\n@dstebila If you want to use it, let me know, and I can download a new copy of your library, integrate it, and put a [temporary] zip in the Kyber directory..\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-01-08T00:56:59Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
