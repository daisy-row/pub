I always use enumerations for this sort of thing, that way if at some point the return codes are expanded to include actual error values, it becomes a simple thing to adjust in the global scope. I guess it comes down to what the return values actually are; if they are boolean, then make them that way, if however, it is expanded to include actual error codes, then 0 for success is preferable."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-01-09T03:39:15Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
