This is not the usual C convention, where 0 is used for success. Moreover, all over the code, there are hard-coded `return 1;` or `return 0;` instead of using the corresponding macros. I propose to change it, and have `#define OQS_SUCCESS 0` and `#define OQS_ERROR -1`, and perhaps a `typedef OQS_STATUS int` or something similar, so it's clear from the function signature whether it returns any `int` or a status code."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-01-06T17:57:53Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
