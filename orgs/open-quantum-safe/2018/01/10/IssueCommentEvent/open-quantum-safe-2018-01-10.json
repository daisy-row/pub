An incrementing domain code is used to initialize Keccak's state to unique values inside the inner loop, and a different domain code should yield a completely different output from SHAKE, even with the same seed, but in this case, the coefficient arrays produced are all identical. \r\nI have traced this to the (sha3.c) OQS_SHA3_cshake128_simple_absorb function. That function adds the domain code to the first state member, transforms the state, and then calls the keccak_absorb function, passing in the modified state. At the top of keccak_absorb, the state is *zeroed*, in effect, erasing the permuted domain code from the state, and hence the identical output is generated.\r\nCan someone confirm this?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/356721622","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/200#issuecomment-356721622","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/200","id":356721622,"user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T20:09:30Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T20:09:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Closed for now since Tancrede has removed the old version of Kyber.
