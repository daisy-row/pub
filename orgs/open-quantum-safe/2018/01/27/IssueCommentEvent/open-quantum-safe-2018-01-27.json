But I am so confused that how to make it work. For many node developers, it seems too hard :cry:  . I can write some c code, so I wanna write it to be a module for Node.js. But, I really don't konw how to compile this lib. When I am testing minimal_sig_oqs.c, I try to use gcc to compile it like this:\r\n```\r\ngcc ./src/sig/minimal_sig_oqs.c  ./src/common/common.c ./src/crypto/aec ./src/crypto/aes/aes_c.c ./src/crypto/aes/aes_ni.c ./src/crypto/rand/rand.c ./src/crypto/rand_urandom_aesctr/rand_urandom_aesctr.c ./src/crypto/rand_urandom_chacha20/rand_urandom_chacha20.c ./src/crypto/sha3/sha3.c ./src/sig/sig.c ./src/sig_picnic/sig_picnic.c  -I ./include -o awesome.o  -lm\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run `./awesome.o`\r\n\r\nI will get a error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: OQS_SIG_new failed!\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am so sad now :cry: "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/361001825","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/218#issuecomment-361001825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/218","id":361001825,"user":{"login":"vsoftco","id":6188943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6188943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco","html_url":"https://github.com/vsoftco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsoftco/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-27T17:52:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-27T17:52:32Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Minimal-example-of-a-post-quantum-signature-in-liboqs) on how to compile and run.
