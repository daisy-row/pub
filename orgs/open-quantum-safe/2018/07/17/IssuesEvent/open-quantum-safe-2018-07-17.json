GeMSS' implementations contain a C++ source file `chooseRootHFE.cpp`, within which NTL is called; all other source files are written in C. The Makefile provided by the submission authors compiles all implementations with `g++`.\r\n\r\nThis requires globally renaming the following symbols:\r\n  - a C symbol to its C++ counterpart, `chooseRootHFE`, in `frobeniusMap.o`;\r\n  - a C++ symbol to its C counterpart, `frobeniusMap`, in `chooseRootHFE.o`;\r\n  - the C++ symbols for `crypto_sign(.*)` to `OQS_SIG_GeMSS_parametrization_\\1`, the latter being C symbols defined in `src/sig/gemss/sig_gemss.c`.\r\n\r\nAfter spending quite some time getting everything to compile, the KAT responses generated by `scripts/check_kats.sh` differ from those I generated with GeMSS' `PQCgenKAT_sign`. I suspect renaming symbols plays a role here.\r\n\r\nUnless #298 is merged quickly, I will submit a PR to @christianpaquin's `cp-nist-branch-add-sig` as soon as I finish writing a gf2x build script (which GeMSS uses). This will be more useful than the description above, but submissions using C++ for NTL is something we need to deal with -- hence me opening this issue --."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-07-17T19:54:07Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
