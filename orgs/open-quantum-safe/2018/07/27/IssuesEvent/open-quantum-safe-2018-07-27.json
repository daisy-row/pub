Looking at the logs, it looks like there is a huge output log related to installing clang-format.  We don't actually need to do the clang-format style checks on all Travis builds.  In fact on nist-branch, we now only do the clang-format check in one Travis build (see the environment variable `CHECK_STYLE` in `.travis.yml` and `.travis/style_check.sh` on nist-branch).  We could probably resolve this build issue and speed up our Travis tests on master by taking the same approach as nist-branch and only doing style check in one build."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-07-27T01:07:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
