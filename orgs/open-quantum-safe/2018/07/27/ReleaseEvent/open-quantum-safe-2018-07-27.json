More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  \r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs (**nist-branch**) focuses on incorporating submissions to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project.  Details about nist-branch can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/nist-branch/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nThis branch of liboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- OpenSSL 1.0.2: A prototype integration of liboqs-based key exchange into TLS 1.2 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.0.2; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_0\\_2-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis snapshot of nist-branch was released on July 27, 2018.  Its release page on Github is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/nist-branch-snapshot-2018-07.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the third snapshot release of liboqs nist-branch.\r\n\r\n### New key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\nThe following KEMs have been added in the 2018-07 snapshot release:\r\n\r\n- **LEDAkem**: 9 parameterizations: `LEDAKEM_C1_N02`, `LEDAKEM_C1_N03`, `LEDAKEM_C1_N04`, `LEDAKEM_C3_N02`, `LEDAKEM_C3_N03`, `LEDAKEM_C3_N04`, `LEDAKEM_C5_N02`, `LEDAKEM_C5_N03`, `LEDAKEM_C5_N04` (contributed by Shravan Mashra (University of Waterloo))\r\n\r\n### New signature API and schemes\r\n\r\nliboqs nist-branch now includes support for signature schemes via the API described in `src/sig/sig.h`; the API is based on the NIST and SUPERCOP APIs.  Signature schemes can be tested using `./test_sig`, benchmarked using `./speed_sig`; `example_sig` contains a minimal example of using the signature API.\r\n\r\nThe following signature schemes have been added in the 2018-07 snapshot release:\r\n\r\n- **Picnic**: 6 parameterizations: `picnic_L1_FS`, `picnic_L1_UR`, `picnic_L3_FS`, `picnic_L3_UR`, `picnic_L5_FS`, `picnic_L5_UR` (contributed by Christian Paquin (Microsoft Research))\r\n- **qTESLA**: 5 parameterizations: `qTESLA_I`, `qTESLA_III_size`, `qTESLA_III_speed`, `qTESLA_p_I`, `qTESLA_p_I` (contributed by Christian Paquin (Microsoft Research))\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- Automatic detection of binutils version for BIKE build (contributed by Maxime Anvari)\r\n\r\nFuture work\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSnapshot releases of nist-branch will be made monthly.  Plans for the next snapshot release of nist-branch can be found online at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/projects/9.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-07-27T14:16:47Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
