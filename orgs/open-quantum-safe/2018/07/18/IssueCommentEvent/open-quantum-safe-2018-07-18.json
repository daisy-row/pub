These sizes are to be set when an instance of the signature algorithm is created via a call to `OQS_new`, and are then used to allocate sufficient memory for keys before calling the algorithm's keygen method. However, some QS signature schemes have varying key sizes (e.g. NIST candidate [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/), which features optional compression for private keys).\r\n\r\nConsidering this, it could be better to let the algorithm's keygen method modify the key size fields appropriately.
