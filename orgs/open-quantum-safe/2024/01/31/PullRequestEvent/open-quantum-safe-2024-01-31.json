I also infer that the reason `find_package(Threads)` was originally gated behind `OQS BUILD_ONLY_LIB` was because only test code used pthreads. Hence, CMake should now always look for the Threads package (on non-MSVC compilers).\r\n\r\nJust doing the above breaks Zephyr builds. Hence, this PR also adds a new CMake variable `OQS_USE_PTHREADS` that will be `true` `if (CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT AND NOT OQS_EMBEDDED_BUILD)`. It also changes code gated on `#CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT` macro to gate on `#OQS_USE_PTHREADS` instead.","created_at":"2024-01-05T18:39:18Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T08:17:57Z","closed_at":"2024-01-31T08:17:56Z","merged_at":"2024-01-31T08:17:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"688bdb431f3d20d5c349e69cba5c130e08c800ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1653/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1653/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1653/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/a4609168b6eab2239d699b7e4aef2eec896accb5","head":{"label":"zxjtan:main","ref":"main","sha":"a4609168b6eab2239d699b7e4aef2eec896accb5","user":{"login":"zxjtan","id":32562011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTYyMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32562011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan","html_url":"https://github.com/zxjtan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":690187954,"node_id":"R_kgDOKSNusg","name":"liboqs","full_name":"zxjtan/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxjtan","id":32562011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTYyMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32562011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan","html_url":"https://github.com/zxjtan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxjtan/liboqs","description":"C
