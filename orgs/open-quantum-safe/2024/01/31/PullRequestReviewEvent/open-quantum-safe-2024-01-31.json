The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

This is similar to #1549, except in this case instead of causing any crashes, the thread-unsafe behaviour simply leads some early callers to believe that the relevant CPU extensions are not available, and hence use reference implementations instead before the extensions are eventually calculated. This can and has set off TSAN.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible in rare instances for the thread calling `set_available_cpu_extensions()` to set `cpu_ext_data[OQS_CPU_EXT_INIT] = 1` and then crash before setting any of the other `cpu_ext_data` fields, preventing future callers from ever calling `set_available_cpu_extensions()` again, thus causing the program to use only reference implementations for its entire lifetime. This PR would also fix this edge case.","created_at":"2024-01-19T18:45:07Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T20:43:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e63377ff66ccf1e2d8651fbe19c2be299bbdba86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/714971836857d6b9486ef497c5a2e67d6f0dd920","head":{"label":"zxjtan:cpu-extensions-pthread-init","ref":"cpu-extensions-pthread-init","sha":"714971836857d6b9486ef497c5a2e67d6f0dd920","user":{"login":"zxjtan","id":32562011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTYyMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32562011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan","html_url":"https://github.com/zxjtan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":690187954,"node_id":"R_kgDOKSNusg","name":"liboqs","full_name":"zxjtan/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zxjtan","id":32562011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTYyMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32562011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan","html_url":"https://github.com/zxjtan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zxjtan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zxjtan/liboqs","description":"C

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
