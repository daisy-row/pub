Incorporating the stateful API in OpenSSL via oqsprovider was a natural choice. As you know, the stateful API makes use of callbacks to refresh secret keys (after one from the pool is used). The work item in question was to   have oqsprovider set that callback.\r\n\r\nThat said, while OpenSSL and oqsprovider are general purpose libraries, I don't know that stateful key and signature generation have general purpose-uses (and especially in light of standards and recommendations). However, signature verification very well could.  And so that is why i support having signature verification be included oqsprovider. I would not add key and sig gen to the provider.\r\n\r\nAs far disabling key/signature generation... that is mostly done now except for handling the test code files written to test them. I will also reach out to Duc who can help me with some of the XMSS test code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1898750195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-18T15:53:25Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
