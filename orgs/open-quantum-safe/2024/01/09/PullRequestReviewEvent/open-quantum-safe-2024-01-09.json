The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management.

This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
