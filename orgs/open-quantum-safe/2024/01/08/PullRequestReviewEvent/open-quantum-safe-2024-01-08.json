The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

This PR automates this process in CI, setting them to run automatically on pull requests for any branch whose name has the prefix `dev-`. This prefix is up for discussion; I used `dev-` because it's what we used for the latest release, and because using `rc-` would cause issues if we ever get a PR from somebody named, say, Ray Charles.\r\n\r\nThe full release tests complete in about 50 minutes in CI—see [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581)—which I think is not too bad. Note that although the linked workflow says it uses a \"minimal set\" of algorithm combinations, it actually does run all combinations; I just didn't update the workflow documentation before pushing. The full set of tests should run again on this PR as a proof of concept; I'll revert to running them only on release candidate PRs once that workflow completes.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow is based on the [`release-test.sh` script in the `oqs-provider` repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh). I didn't call the script directly since some aspects (checking out a new temporary branch then resetting back to main, cloning liboqs, etc) were either unnecessary in the CI setting or better handled by a built-in action.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- What prefix do we want to use for release candidates?\r\n- Is there a way to ensure that this script stays in sync with `oqs-provider` release testing requirements?\r\n- For @baentsch specifically: what version of OpenSSL should we be checking against here? I defaulted to `master` as the [release test documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh#L33) said to use the \"latest\" version.\r\n- Do we want to also automate some of the other release testing? We could, for example, also run the full constant time tests as part of this workflow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1647 (assuming that `oqs-provider` is the only downstream for which we want automated release testing).\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

This PR automates this process in CI, setting them to run automatically on pull requests for any branch whose name has the prefix `dev-`. This prefix is up for discussion; I used `dev-` because it's what we used for the latest release, and because using `rc-` would cause issues if we ever get a PR from somebody named, say, Ray Charles.\r\n\r\nThe full release tests complete in about 50 minutes in CI—see [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581)—which I think is not too bad. Note that although the linked workflow says it uses a \"minimal set\" of algorithm combinations, it actually does run all combinations; I just didn't update the workflow documentation before pushing. The full set of tests should run again on this PR as a proof of concept; I'll revert to running them only on release candidate PRs once that workflow completes.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow is based on the [`release-test.sh` script in the `oqs-provider` repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh). I didn't call the script directly since some aspects (checking out a new temporary branch then resetting back to main, cloning liboqs, etc) were either unnecessary in the CI setting or better handled by a built-in action.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- What prefix do we want to use for release candidates?\r\n- Is there a way to ensure that this script stays in sync with `oqs-provider` release testing requirements?\r\n- For @baentsch specifically: what version of OpenSSL should we be checking against here? I defaulted to `master` as the [release test documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh#L33) said to use the \"latest\" version.\r\n- Do we want to also automate some of the other release testing? We could, for example, also run the full constant time tests as part of this workflow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1647 (assuming that `oqs-provider` is the only downstream for which we want automated release testing).\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
