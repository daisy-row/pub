We didn't properly run `copy_from_upstream` to update documentation before 0.9.0 (#1586), and there was a bug in the script which was fixed in #1589. Since this branch is based on 0.9.1, which was based on 0.9.0, it didn't include the subsequent documentation updates or the `copy_from_upstream` bug fix. I checked out the post-#1589 version of `copy_from_upstream`, as well as the fixed CI workflow to check for idempotence, so that the release documentation would be correct.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1881082757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-08T14:09:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
