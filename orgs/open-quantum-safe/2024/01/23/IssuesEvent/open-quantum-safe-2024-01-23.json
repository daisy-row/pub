the bug**\r\nBoth Falcon-512 and Falcon-1024 variants return a variable length signature. This is observed in the **test_sig** correctness test by\r\nprinting the output variable **signature_len**  after the sign() function is called:  https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/tests/test_sig.c. The test will pass because **signature_len** is an output computed internally by the sign() function specifying the length of the generated signature returned and the same length signature is verified by the verify() function.  **signature_len** is given as input to verify().\r\n\r\nsign() and verify() should be updated to fixed length signatures.\r\n\r\nrc = OQS_SIG_sign(sig, _signature_, **&signature_len**, message, message_len, secret_key);\r\n\r\nrc = OQS_SIG_verify(sig, message, message_len, _signature_, **signature_len**, public_key);\r\n\r\nfor [pqclean_falcon-512_clean](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean), internally that would be: \r\n**PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_comp_encode()**\r\nin https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/codec.c\r\n\r\ncalled by:\r\nstatic int do_sign(uint8_t *nonce, uint8_t *sigbuf, size_t *sigbuflen, const uint8_t *m, size_t mlen, const uint8_t *sk) ()\r\nin https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c\r\nwhich is called by:\r\nPQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_crypto_sign_signature() \r\nin https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.
