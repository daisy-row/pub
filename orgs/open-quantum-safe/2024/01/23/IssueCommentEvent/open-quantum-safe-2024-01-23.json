In some situations, it's useful to generate keypairs deterministically from a seed. When [RFC9180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#name-cryptographic-dependencies) defines a KEM, they include a `DeriveKeyPair` option to generate keypairs deterministically from a seed. As an example use case, [Messaging Layer Security](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html) makes extensive use of functionality to share multiple keypairs by communicating seeds. I think it would be nice to match RFC9180 and add a functionality to deterministically derive a keypair from a seed.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of possible in liboqs currently. You can set the randomness to use `OQS_RAND_alg_nist_kat`, and derive all the randomness used from a seed, but this is a somewhat imperfect solution for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- The seed must be exactly 48 bytes\r\n- It references a global variable, resulting in concurrency issues\r\n- Modifying the randomness used is (to my knowledge) not available with any of the liboqs language wrappers\r\n\r\nI'm curious if others think this is a functionality worth adding and if so, what the proper way to tackle it might be. Some schemes, like Kyber, are already constructed in such a way that everything is derived from a seed, but liboqs provides limited ability to set that seed. I suspect the situation for other schemes is much more complex.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1906885749","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206#issuecomment-1906885749","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206","id":1906885749,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5xqMR1","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-23T20:42:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T20:42:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It seems like this feature will be mostly \"free\" in the [soon-to-be-integrated](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1626) ML-KEM (formerly known as Kyber)—we would just have to add the necessary OQS API functions to expose the functionality.
