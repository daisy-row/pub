That is, using the 'stateless' API to verify a 'stateful' signature.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, that may sound \"unconventional\" -- but the question seems to be: Is it logically right? And technically doable, i.e., is signature state sufficiently encoded in the signatures to permit verification? If the latter, I don't really see a mismatch: OQS_SIG then (continues to) support state-free signature operations (on all algorithms supporting that) while OQS_SIG_STFL adds functionality for stateful operations (on those algs needing/supporting this).\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting idea... are we using the prefix `OQS_SIG_` to denote the family of algorithm or a class of functionality?\r\n\r\nIn the context of key generation, both `OQS_KEM_..._keygen` and `OQS_SIG_..._keygen` have the same function signature (output a public key and secret key pair) and both are intended for the same purpose (key generation), but we prefixed them separately rather than have a generic `OQS_..._keygen`.  \r\n\r\nGranted, `SIG` and `SIG_STFL` are \"closer\" conceptually than KEM and SIG.\r\n\r\nI don't have a conclusion at this point, but you made me think.

The code to activate `keygen` of OQS_SIG_STFL in turn however would need a completely new logic and support structure (as would SIG_STFL:sign) -- both [moot points](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#issuecomment-1895747286).\r\n\r\n> I don't have a conclusion at this point, but you made me think.\r\n\r\nThanks. I in turn am also re-thinking my original proposal to activate this OQS_SIG \"verify-only\" API if \"OQS_ALLOW_SFTL_KEY_AND_SIG_GEN\" is not set: I now begin to wonder whether this should always be used: This would also make it clear to every user which of the SIG_STFL operations are \"different\" (not saying [dangerous](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#issuecomment-1893957110)).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1917072095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-30T14:55:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
