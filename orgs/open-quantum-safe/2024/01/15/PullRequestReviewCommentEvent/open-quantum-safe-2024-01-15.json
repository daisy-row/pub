Zephyrs CMake infrastructure calls the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the `zephyr` directory of each module (in non-deterministic order). All CMake build environment variables (e.g. `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`) are set by the Zephyr CMake infrastructure to its own, sometimes “uncommon” values (e.g. “arm” for all 32-bit ARM targets, “arm64” for all 64-bit targets and “x86” for all 32-bit **and** 64-bit x86 targets). Within the `zephyr/CMakeLists.txt` file, the main liboqs `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory is called. Hence, we have to convert the “custom” Zephyr build environment variables to the generic ones used in the root `CMakeLists.txt` to not have to make custom changes to that file exclusively for the Zephyr port (e.g. changing `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` to “x86_64” in case the Zephyr value is “x86” and the 64-bit configuration is enabled, indicating “x86_64”). \r\n\r\nHowever, as there may be other Zephyr modules parsed after liboqs, we have to undo our modifications of the build environment variables to not interfere with other modules (and their potential workarounds). As this cleanup is done after the parsing of the root `CMakeLists.txt` of liboqs, the temporal workarounds only apply to those build targets.
