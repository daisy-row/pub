I've added it to the 0.10.0 milestone for the latter reason.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\nFixes #1648.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\nYes, the API is changed, but it's not much. The NIST DRBG is no longer exposed in the public API. This means changes to two public API functions: `OQS_randombytes_switch_algorithm` will now error when passed the string \"NIST-KAT\" (with or without capitalization) and `OQS_randombytes_nist_kat_init_256bit` has been deleted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
