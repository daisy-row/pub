But \"security by complexity\" isn't a good argument :-/\r\n\r\nSo what about the suggestion to move this to a separate OQS subproject? It anyway has a (IMO significantly different) API from `liboqs` (sig API), so why not split it out completely? @dstebila @ducnguyen-sb @ashman-p ?

The decision to move forward was based on providing space for experimentation and research. Keep in mind also that the library provides no key management features/capabilities at all. And so there is no risk as was mentioned in the above comment. Any application writer has to provide means to store and manage key states, as that is outside the boundary of the library. (There have been other comments about this feature not being usable off-the-shelf because of this reason).\r\n> Your thoughts?\r\n\r\nThe fact Security Critical state is not managed at all by the implementation makes the situation worse if it is even possible.\r\n\r\nLeaving to non-cryptographer the task of figuring out how to \"hold it right\" does not really change the fact this is extremely dangerous code to have available, even people that should know better have been found to ask CMVP to allow them to backup XMSS/LMS keys from FIPS certified HMSs ... which is bonkers if you think of it.\r\nAssuming the general public can use these APIs sanely is a lost bet IMHO.\r\n\r\nMost software developers have no idea how to safely use even relatively safe APIs.\r\nThis is basically a foot gun where the manufacturer declares that the safety latch is on the gun owner to implement ...\r\n\r\nI agree with @baentsch that it is unclear whether XMSS/LMS can really be used safely.\r\n\r\nPersonally I even think these primitives should be deprecated and not be considered going forward now that we have Quantum resistant algorithms like Dilithium or SPHINCS+. The operational management challenges are just a nightmare ... the risk is not worth it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1894061793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-16T16:13:17Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The question was asked about a key difference between stateful APIs and the current stateless ones. I think my response might have left the impression that this stateful feature did nothing to manage updating the secret key state. If so, i gave the wrong impression. This implementation does update key states when needed. However, it does not provide secret key storage. And in this regard is no different than the current APIs.\r\nThe current APIs do not provide secure key storage. It does not manage keys. Key management is outside the scope of this library. \r\nThe new thing required by the stateful API is that a callback must be supplied, which is called when the key needs to be saved (on key/signature generation). In most cases it is always up to the application to provide a suitable means to secure secret keys. This is now a requirement for stateful APIs.\r\n\r\nAlso, the answer to how OpenSSL would support stateful schemes... it could not without modifications because there currently isn't a means for OpenSSL to supply the needed callback.\r\n\r\nLet me know if this makes the design any clearer. \r\nThanks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1894577242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-16T21:54:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
