The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

While it also clarifies roles, responsibilities and expectations to contributors at different levels, it is of most relevance only in situations if decisions cannot be reached using lazy consensus but a more \"formal\" approach to decision-making is needed.\n+Decision making in the project will follow the principles above, and be governed first and foremost by reason and mutually respectful interaction between all contributors.\n+The project will aim to build consensus for decisions, and will where possible operate by the approach of [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html).\n+If decisions cannot be reached using lazy consensus, voting will be used to come to a resolution.\n \n-The following therefore defines the roles of project contributors, the associated rights and responsibilities, and the process for transitioning between them. As such, this document is written in a fairly formal and precise tone, so as to be succint and unambiguous. This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish. We welcome all questions, discussions, and contributions, and we would love to have more people on board.\n+## Community and Roles\n \n-We recognize that some of the policies discussed here can seem intimidating---for instance, revocation of privileges or code of conduct violations. It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n-\n-## Roles\n+The OQS community is open to all who would like to participate in the project following its principles, including contributors in academia, government, or industry, and individual contributors.\n \n The following roles exist in the project:\n \n-1. Maintainer: Person with GitHub administrative rights.\n+### Users\n+\n+A **User** is a person or organization using software produced by the project.\n+\n+### Community Members\n+\n+A **Community Member** is a User who interacts with the project, for example by participating in discussions on Github or mailing lists, or in project meetings.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n+\n+- Follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n+\n+### Contributors\n+\n+A **Contributor** is a Community Member who contributes directly to the project by submitting code or documentation, or actively participating in issues or pull requests on Github.\n+\n+### Committers\n+\n+A **Committer** is a Contributor with increased experience in the project who helps review pull requests and actively participates in discussions about the project. Committers will be members of the open-quantum-safe GitHub organization and will have \"write\" permissions in GitHub.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n \n-2.
