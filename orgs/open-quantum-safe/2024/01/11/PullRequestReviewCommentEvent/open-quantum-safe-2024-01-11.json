What function need to be guarded with this function in a concurrent environment? \r\n\r\nOnly the Signing operation.\r\n\r\nThanks to your question, I updated this note: \r\n\r\n```\r\n* @note It's not necessary to use this function in either Keygen or Verifying operations.\r\n *       In a concurrent environment, the user is responsible for locking and unlocking the private key,\r\n *       to make sure that only one thread can access the private key during a Signing operation.\r\n ```\r\n\r\n2. Why such lock/unlock APIs are there? Is it meant we strive to be a thread-safe library?\r\n\r\nThese APIs intention is to limit to one owner of private key at a time in a concurrent environment.\r\nIf users supply lock/unlock logic with a mutex, we acquire the lock to be the only owner of the private key, and unlock after the Signing operation complete. \r\nIf users don't  supply the lock/unlock logic or a mutex, they are simply NOP operations. \r\n\r\nI think the key different here is: We don't execute stateful signature in multi-thread  at the library itself, but we provide a way to let users use multi-thread securely, in the right way. \r\n\r\n3. Does it need such liboqs-based \"lock/unlock\" functions at all if such documentation exists? \r\n\r\nI think to have `lock/unlock` functions help liboqs in:\r\n\r\n- Testing. Someone has to foreseen the usage of our proposed APIs in multi-thread environment, so we need `lock/unlock` to test if it's still safe in such if our low-level implementation change. \r\n\r\nSo we have it in test, well, why not exposed them to library user, it's convenience anyway. So there are `liboqs`-based `lock/unlock` functions.\r\n\r\n4. Why isn't use of any external, e.g. as provided by the application-chosen threading library, lock/unlock mechanisms sufficient?\r\n\r\nActually we don't concretely define the `lock/unlock` mechanisms in `liboqs`, if the function pointers of `lock/unlock` are non-NULL then we will run them to perform `lock/unlock` the private key. \r\n\r\nSo, we open to any application-chosen threading library, and it's user responsibility to create a proper `lock/unlock` functions, and it's up to them to define their `mutex`. \r\n\r\n5. Anything in between IMO has the potential for a \"support nightmare\" (\"use API XYZ if you are using threading library ABC; if not using any threading, disregard XYZ but use API XZZ\", etc....)\r\n\r\nI totally agree with you, we don't want to get into \"support nightmare\". I want to run away from it as far as possible. :)) \r\n\r\nYou have more experience than me in this matter, please let me know if there is something I need to change to get out of \"support nightmare\".\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-11T15:51:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T15:51:03Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655#discussion_r1449060897","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1655","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1449060897"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655#discussion_r1449060897"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1655"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1449060897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":581,"original_line":543,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1446332242,"original_position":359,"position":410,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1655","id":1669588908,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5jg-es","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1655","number":1655,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Update `sig_stfl.h` document for #1650","user":{"login":"ducnguyen-sb","id":106774416,"node_id":"U_kgDOBl0_kA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106774416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb","html_url":"https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"This PR address the comments in #1650 \r\n\r\nThis PR rewrite the documentation in `sig_stfl.h` header for a few APIs, make simpler and (somewhat) easier to read. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

My \"general\" question regarding minimizing support effort is: Could we completely do away with those functions in the external OQS API? If we could, we won't have to support them.\r\n\r\n> So we have it in test, well, why not exposed them to library user, it's convenience anyway. So there are liboqs-based lock/unlock functions.\r\n\r\nThat's what I'm concerned with: If it's mere \"convenience\" (for us) we shouldn't externally make it available.
