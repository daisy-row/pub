This PR add `OQS_MEM_checked_malloc` and `OQS_MEM_checked_aligned_alloc`. \r\nTwo APIs will abruptly exit the program, but *at least* let user know what happens. \r\nFor now, it's close to impossible to propagate errors to callers without a lot of rewrite in the library.\r\n\r\n## Use `memcpy` instead of for loop\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern in `sha2_armv8.c` and `sha2_c.c` that use the for loop to perform an array copy. \r\nChanged to `memcpy`. This change enables compiler optimizations. \r\n\r\n## Add Stateful signature flags to `CONFIGURE.md`\r\n\r\nFixed minor grammar errors, and add stateful signature flags description.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
