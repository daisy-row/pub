Removing them completely/for all other PQC would not meet with my unlimited enthusiasm (pardon the Germanic person trying English humour). \r\n\r\nAssuming that understanding, such approach would be possible but entail somewhat pointless work:\r\n1) Integrate the new OQS \"stfl_sig\" API into `oqsprovider`, adding all kinds of \"bookkeeping shenanigans\" to enable this new data structure\r\n2) Disabling calls to keygen/sign for such algorithms -- and thus, the only two calls that require step 1 -- and that I then call pointless.\r\n\r\nWhat about the alternative proposal to build `liboqs` by default to enable SHS (stateful hashbased signatures -- XMSS/LMS) support _behind the current OQS_SIG API_ (as discussed about a year ago)? keygen and sign of course then couldn't work (without the ability to update state/private key after sign) but data structure setup via [OQS_SIG_new](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/61e0fa99da04dccff936c9c237f3ca72f810ede6/src/sig/sig.h#L186C18-L186C29) and [OQS_SIG_verify](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/61e0fa99da04dccff936c9c237f3ca72f810ede6/src/sig/sig.h#L230) would work, thus making `oqsprovider` work as suggested (not supporting SHS sign/keygen) -- pretty much automatically.\r\n\r\nOpen question of course: How to generate the (SHS) data to be verified without using keygen/sign (as is presently done for OQS SIG algs)? Are there acceptable/hardware-based tools that could provide such data? \r\n\r\nIf not, what about the idea to create a completely new (separate from `oqsprovider`), say `insecure-shs-provider`? \r\n\r\nSuch thing maybe somewhat \"generated\" from the `oqsprovider` code base by completely eliminating KEM support and replacing OQS_SIG support with OQS_STFL_SIG support. That appears to be pretty straightforward given \"OQS_STFL_SIG\" has been created following the \"OQS_SIG\" API. This provider could then be used to generate test data for the verification-only `oqsprovider`. And of course, we would not make binaries available for that thing.\r\n\r\nBut this proposal comes full circle and triggers a question to the statement that started the discussion:\r\n\r\n> Putting XMSS/LMS signature generation out there in a software library is borderline irresponsible to be honest.\r\n\r\n@simo5: Do you challenge the notion of making SHS sig gen available via _any_ software library or `liboqs` specifically? The former feels like a task of putting a genie back in a bottle while the latter is surely more easily achievable (admittedly I never had a genie and a bottle at hand to try the former :-).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1895392315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-17T09:13:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
