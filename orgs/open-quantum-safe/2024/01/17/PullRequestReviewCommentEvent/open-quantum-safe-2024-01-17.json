Secret keys can only used once to generate a signature.\n+Multiple signing with same key can reveal that key to an attacker.\n+Because of this, NIST recommends that key and signature aeration be done in hardware security modules.\n+Having said that, this library is fully functional for research purposes. Storage and management of the secret keys are left update applications using this feature.\n+Secret key storage is easily done when by supplying a callback function to the library.\n+\n+\n+Key State Management:\n+Application writers have to supply callback functions to store and update secret keys.\n+After a sign operation the secret key index is advanced and stored. This ensures one-time use of the key.\n+Signing operations will fail without this callback set because the private key cannot be advance (to prevent reuse).","path":"docs/algorithms/sig_stfl/sig_stfl.md","commit_id":"8f3ae22ca7d8a0255fb119cb6cceb3be66973c8a","original_commit_id":"8ac8f3f4285906bfae8259123291618051e9cd5e","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Fixed.","created_at":"2024-01-17T03:48:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T03:48:40Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663#discussion_r1454506910","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1454506910"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663#discussion_r1454506910"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1454506910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":20,"original_line":20,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1452760707,"original_position":20,"position":20,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663","id":1676868605,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5j8vv9","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1663","number":1663,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Update documentation and license text.","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdded doc for Stateful Signature, XMSS, LMS and update licenses per file in LMS directories.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Secret keys can only used once to generate a signature.\n+Multiple signing with same key can reveal that key to an attacker.\n+Because of this, NIST recommends that key and signature aeration be done in hardware security modules.\n+Having said that, this library is fully functional for research purposes. Storage and management of the secret keys are left update applications using this feature.\n+Secret key storage is easily done when by supplying a callback function to the library.\n+\n+\n+Key State Management:\n+Application writers have to supply callback functions to store and update secret keys.\n+After a sign operation the secret key index is advanced and stored. This ensures one-time use of the key.\n+Signing operations will fail without this callback set because the private key cannot be advance (to prevent reuse).\n+\n+Stateful keys can generate a finite number signatures. A counter tracks the limit when the key is created and is decremented after each signature is generated.","path":"docs/algorithms/sig_stfl/sig_stfl.md","commit_id":"8f3ae22ca7d8a0255fb119cb6cceb3be66973c8a","original_commit_id":"8ac8f3f4285906bfae8259123291618051e9cd5e","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Fixed.","created_at":"2024-01-17T03:49:23Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T03:49:23Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663#discussion_r1454507904","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1454507904"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663#discussion_r1454507904"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1454507904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":22,"original_line":22,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1452760791,"original_position":22,"position":22,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663","id":1676868605,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5j8vv9","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1663","number":1663,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Update documentation and license text.","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdded doc for Stateful Signature, XMSS, LMS and update licenses per file in LMS directories.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Secret keys can only used once to generate a signature.\n+Multiple signing with same key can reveal that key to an attacker.\n+Because of this, NIST recommends that key and signature aeration be done in hardware security modules.\n+Having said that, this library is fully functional for research purposes. Storage and management of the secret keys are left update applications using this feature.\n+Secret key storage is easily done when by supplying a callback function to the library.\n+\n+\n+Key State Management:\n+Application writers have to supply callback functions to store and update secret keys.\n+After a sign operation the secret key index is advanced and stored. This ensures one-time use of the key.\n+Signing operations will fail without this callback set because the private key cannot be advance (to prevent reuse).\n+\n+Stateful keys can generate a finite number signatures. A counter tracks the limit when the key is created and is decremented after each signature is generated.\n+When the counter is down to 0, signature generations fails. Applications can query the remaining count via an API.","path":"docs/algorithms/sig_stfl/sig_stfl.md","commit_id":"8f3ae22ca7d8a0255fb119cb6cceb3be66973c8a","original_commit_id":"8ac8f3f4285906bfae8259123291618051e9cd5e","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Fixed.","created_at":"2024-01-17T03:49:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T03:49:57Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663#discussion_r1454508739","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1454508739"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663#discussion_r1454508739"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1454508739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":23,"original_line":23,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1452760888,"original_position":23,"position":23,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1663","id":1676868605,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5j8vv9","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1663.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1663","number":1663,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Update documentation and license text.","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdded doc for Stateful Signature, XMSS, LMS and update licenses per file in LMS directories.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Secret keys can only used once to generate a signature.\n+Multiple signing with same key can reveal that key to an attacker.\n+Because of this, NIST recommends that key and signature aeration be done in hardware security modules.\n+Having said that, this library is fully functional for research purposes. Storage and management of the secret keys are left update applications using this feature.\n+Secret key storage is easily done when by supplying a callback function to the library.\n+\n+\n+Key State Management:\n+Application writers have to supply callback functions to store and update secret keys.\n+After a sign operation the secret key index is advanced and stored. This ensures one-time use of the key.\n+Signing operations will fail without this callback set because the private key cannot be advance (to prevent reuse).\n+\n+Stateful keys can generate a finite number signatures. A counter tracks the limit when the key is created and is decremented after each signature is generated.\n+When the counter is down to 0, signature generations fails. Applications can query the remaining count via an API.\n+\n+Multithreaded application will need to set lock and unlock callbacks for the library to use.
