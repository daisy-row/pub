It appears that a new line has been introduced, rendering the constant time check invalid. Consequently, adjusting the line location by 1 resolves the issue. To enhance clarity, I have separated the checks for Generic and AVX2. Additionally, I have eliminated some redundant checks for a more streamlined code.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #1617. \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
