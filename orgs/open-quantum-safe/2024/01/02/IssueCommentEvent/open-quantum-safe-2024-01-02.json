That said, the error in thinking is arguably on my side: When trying to release \"oqsprovider\" 0.5.3 I didn't consider that HQC had not been updated in `liboqs` 0.9.1, so I would have had to release `oqsprovider` with an old (the \"0.9.0\" labelled) code generator config file but didn't do so. In other words, the 0.5.3 RC for \"oqsprovider\" is not getting published but we wait for `liboqs` 0.9.2 as discussed. It would be nice to do a proper new functional release of `oqsprovider` in the near future, too and not wait with that until `liboqs` releases 0.10.0 at some unknown future time.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1874380310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-02T18:18:24Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Looks like my thinking was wrong, not a commit missing. Go ahead with 0.9.2 \r\n\r\nThanks Michael. Okay, no cherry-picking the HQC commit over to 0.9.2.\r\n\r\n> and we'll decide separately whether or not it warrants an `oqsprovider` release (right now I tend to think it doesn't: The question basically is whether we provide `oqsprovider` executables containing 0.9.2 (via CI&release) or whether we let people build them themselves (i.e., not do an `oqsprovider` release for this).\r\n\r\nAre we providing executables based on 0.9.0?  Because this is a security release, I would want to discourage people from using 0.9.0, so would replace anything we're providing based on 0.9.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1874410285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-02T18:47:21Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
