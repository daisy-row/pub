It appears that a new line has been introduced, rendering the constant time check invalid. Consequently, adjusting the line location by 1 resolves the issue. To enhance clarity, I have separated the checks for Generic and AVX2. Additionally, I have eliminated some redundant checks for a more streamlined code.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #1617. \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

It appears that a new line has been introduced, rendering the constant time check invalid. Consequently, adjusting the line location by 1 resolves the issue. To enhance clarity, I have separated the checks for Generic and AVX2. Additionally, I have eliminated some redundant checks for a more streamlined code.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #1617. \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

It appears that a new line has been introduced, rendering the constant time check invalid. Consequently, adjusting the line location by 1 resolves the issue. To enhance clarity, I have separated the checks for Generic and AVX2. Additionally, I have eliminated some redundant checks for a more streamlined code.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #1617. \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

It appears that a new line has been introduced, rendering the constant time check invalid. Consequently, adjusting the line location by 1 resolves the issue. To enhance clarity, I have separated the checks for Generic and AVX2. Additionally, I have eliminated some redundant checks for a more streamlined code.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #1617. \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and
