While it also clarifies roles, responsibilities and expectations to contributors at different levels, it is of most relevance only in situations if decisions cannot be reached using lazy consensus but a more \"formal\" approach to decision-making is needed.\n+Decision making in the project will follow the principles above, and be governed first and foremost by reason and mutually respectful interaction between all contributors.\n+The project will aim to build consensus for decisions, and will where possible operate by the approach of [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html).\n+If decisions cannot be reached using lazy consensus, voting will be used to come to a resolution.\n \n-The following therefore defines the roles of project contributors, the associated rights and responsibilities, and the process for transitioning between them. As such, this document is written in a fairly formal and precise tone, so as to be succint and unambiguous. This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish. We welcome all questions, discussions, and contributions, and we would love to have more people on board.\n+## Community and Roles\n \n-We recognize that some of the policies discussed here can seem intimidating---for instance, revocation of privileges or code of conduct violations. It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n-\n-## Roles\n+The OQS community is open to all who would like to participate in the project following its principles, including contributors in academia, government, or industry, and individual contributors.\n \n The following roles exist in the project:\n \n-1. Maintainer: Person with GitHub administrative rights.\n+### Users\n+\n+A **User** is a person or organization using software produced by the project.\n+\n+### Community Members\n+\n+A **Community Member** is a User who interacts with the project, for example by participating in discussions on Github or mailing lists, or in project meetings.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n+\n+- Follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n+\n+### Contributors\n+\n+A **Contributor** is a Community Member who contributes directly to the project by submitting code or documentation, or actively participating in issues or pull requests on Github.\n+\n+### Committers\n+\n+A **Committer** is a Contributor with increased experience in the project who helps review pull requests and actively participates in discussions about the project. Committers will be members of the open-quantum-safe GitHub organization and will have \"write\" permissions in GitHub.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n \n-2. Committer: Person with GitHub \"Write\" privileges; this entails the right and obligation to review PRs by Contributors and to actively participate in discussions.\n+- Monitor and respond to GitHub issues.\n+- Review and merge pull requests.\n+- Assist with security releases when required.\n+- Participate in discussions and project meetings.\n \n-3. Contributor: Person that has contributed code.\n+### Maintainers\n \n-4. Users: Person using the project passively or actively, e.g., by participating in discussions.\n+A **Maintainer** is Committer who makes significant and sustained contributions to the project, and is committed to guiding the direction of the project. Maintainers will have \"administrative\" permissions in GitHub.\n \n-## Relationships between roles\n+Responsibilities:\n \n-Any User may also be a Contributor. Any Contributor may also be a Committer. Any Committer may also be a Maintainer. A Maintainer must be a Committer.\n+- Oversee the overall project health and growth.\n+- Lead communication for the project.\n+- Define general and technical guidelines for the project.\n+- Identify priorities and manage the release cycle.\n \n-## Change of role\n+### Change of role\n \n-Any User may become a Contributor by creating a pull request (PR) and getting it successfully reviewed and merged by Committers.\n+Any Community Member may become a Contributor by creating a pull request (PR) and getting it successfully reviewed and merged by Committers.\n \n Any Contributor can become a Committer by contributing sufficient code and displaying deep subject matter knowledge in discussions such that a majority of Committers vote for this change of role. A Maintainer can veto such a vote. Such a veto can be overruled by a 2/3 majority of Committers.\n \n-As such a voting decision may be considered subjective, Contributors striving to become Committers are encouraged to ask for advice by Committers as to what---if anything---should be done to attain this status (additional to already documented knowledge in contributions). Baseline requirements for contributions are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Any Contributor can create a discussion item to request a vote to become Committer.\n+As such a voting decision may be considered subjective, Contributors striving to become Committers are encouraged to ask for advice by Committers as to what they can do to obtain this role.

We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish.

This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish. We welcome all questions, discussions, and contributions, and we would love to have more people on board.\n+## Community and Roles\n \n-We recognize that some of the policies discussed here can seem intimidating---for instance, revocation of privileges or code of conduct violations. It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n-\n-## Roles\n+The OQS community is open to all who would like to participate in the project following its principles, including contributors in academia, government, or industry, and individual contributors.\n \n The following roles exist in the project:\n \n-1.

While it also clarifies roles, responsibilities and expectations to contributors at different levels, it is of most relevance only in situations if decisions cannot be reached using lazy consensus but a more \"formal\" approach to decision-making is needed.\n+Decision making in the project will follow the principles above, and be governed first and foremost by reason and mutually respectful interaction between all contributors.\n+The project will aim to build consensus for decisions, and will where possible operate by the approach of [lazy consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html).\n+If decisions cannot be reached using lazy consensus, voting will be used to come to a resolution.\n \n-The following therefore defines the roles of project contributors, the associated rights and responsibilities, and the process for transitioning between them. As such, this document is written in a fairly formal and precise tone, so as to be succint and unambiguous. This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish. We welcome all questions, discussions, and contributions, and we would love to have more people on board.\n+## Community and Roles\n \n-We recognize that some of the policies discussed here can seem intimidating---for instance, revocation of privileges or code of conduct violations. It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n-\n-## Roles\n+The OQS community is open to all who would like to participate in the project following its principles, including contributors in academia, government, or industry, and individual contributors.\n \n The following roles exist in the project:\n \n-1. Maintainer: Person with GitHub administrative rights.\n+### Users\n+\n+A **User** is a person or organization using software produced by the project.\n+\n+### Community Members\n+\n+A **Community Member** is a User who interacts with the project, for example by participating in discussions on Github or mailing lists, or in project meetings.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n+\n+- Follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n+\n+### Contributors\n+\n+A **Contributor** is a Community Member who contributes directly to the project by submitting code or documentation, or actively participating in issues or pull requests on Github.\n+\n+### Committers\n+\n+A **Committer** is a Contributor with increased experience in the project who helps review pull requests and actively participates in discussions about the project. Committers will be members of the open-quantum-safe GitHub organization and will have \"write\" permissions in GitHub.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n \n-2.

As such, this document is written in a fairly formal and precise tone, so as to be succint and unambiguous. This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish.

It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n-\n-## Roles\n+The OQS community is open to all who would like to participate in the project following its principles, including contributors in academia, government, or industry, and individual contributors.\n \n The following roles exist in the project:\n \n-1. Maintainer: Person with GitHub administrative rights.\n+### Users\n+\n+A **User** is a person or organization using software produced by the project.\n+\n+### Community Members\n+\n+A **Community Member** is a User who interacts with the project, for example by participating in discussions on Github or mailing lists, or in project meetings.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n+\n+- Follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n+\n+### Contributors\n+\n+A **Contributor** is a Community Member who contributes directly to the project by submitting code or documentation, or actively participating in issues or pull requests on Github.\n+\n+### Committers\n+\n+A **Committer** is a Contributor with increased experience in the project who helps review pull requests and actively participates in discussions about the project. Committers will be members of the open-quantum-safe GitHub organization and will have \"write\" permissions in GitHub.\n+\n+Responsibilities:\n \n-2. Committer: Person with GitHub \"Write\" privileges; this entails the right and obligation to review PRs by Contributors and to actively participate in discussions.\n+- Monitor and respond to GitHub issues.\n+- Review and merge pull requests.\n+- Assist with security releases when required.\n+- Participate in discussions and project meetings.\n \n-3. Contributor: Person that has contributed code.\n+### Maintainers\n \n-4. Users: Person using the project passively or actively, e.g., by participating in discussions.\n+A **Maintainer** is Committer who makes significant and sustained contributions to the project, and is committed to guiding the direction of the project. Maintainers will have \"administrative\" permissions in GitHub.\n \n-## Relationships between roles\n+Responsibilities:\n \n-Any User may also be a Contributor. Any Contributor may also be a Committer. Any Committer may also be a Maintainer. A Maintainer must be a Committer.\n+- Oversee the overall project health and growth.\n+- Lead communication for the project.\n+- Define general and technical guidelines for the project.\n+- Identify priorities and manage the release cycle.\n \n-## Change of role\n+### Change of role\n \n-Any User may become a Contributor by creating a pull request (PR) and getting it successfully reviewed and merged by Committers.\n+Any Community Member may become a Contributor by creating a pull request (PR) and getting it successfully reviewed and merged by Committers.\n \n Any Contributor can become a Committer by contributing sufficient code and displaying deep subject matter knowledge in discussions such that a majority of Committers vote for this change of role. A Maintainer can veto such a vote. Such a veto can be overruled by a 2/3 majority of Committers.\n \n-As such a voting decision may be considered subjective, Contributors striving to become Committers are encouraged to ask for advice by Committers as to what---if anything---should be done to attain this status (additional to already documented knowledge in contributions). Baseline requirements for contributions are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

As such, this document is written in a fairly formal and precise tone, so as to be succint and unambiguous. This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish. We welcome all questions, discussions, and contributions, and we would love to have more people on board.\n+## Community and Roles\n \n-We recognize that some of the policies discussed here can seem intimidating---for instance, revocation of privileges or code of conduct violations. It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n-\n-## Roles\n+The OQS community is open to all who would like to participate in the project following its principles, including contributors in academia, government, or industry, and individual contributors.\n \n The following roles exist in the project:\n \n-1.
