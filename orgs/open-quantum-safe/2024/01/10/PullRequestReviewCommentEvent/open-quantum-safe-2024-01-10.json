The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

And a much more basic question: If there are such library functions failing to properly operate in a multi-threaded environment, wouldn't it be better to document _them_ accordingly? And as follow-on question: Does it need such `liboqs`-based \"lock/unlock\" functions at all if such documentation exists? Why isn't use of any external, e.g. as provided by the application-chosen threading library, lock/unlock mechanisms sufficient?\r\n\r\nI guess what I'd like to suggest in a more \"brutal question\": Should we not strive to implement a thread-safe library API OR completely get out of the way (giving the app developer full control of what they want/need to do)? Anything in between IMO has the potential for a \"support nightmare\" (\"use API XYZ if you are using threading library ABC; if not using any threading, disregard XYZ but use API XZZ\", etc....)","created_at":"2024-01-10T07:11:36Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T07:11:36Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655#discussion_r1446965281","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1655","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1446965281"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655#discussion_r1446965281"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1655"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1446965281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":579,"original_line":543,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1446332242,"original_position":359,"position":408,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1655","id":1669588908,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5jg-es","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1655.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1655","number":1655,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Update `sig_stfl.h` document for #1650","user":{"login":"ducnguyen-sb","id":106774416,"node_id":"U_kgDOBl0_kA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106774416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb","html_url":"https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ducnguyen-sb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"This PR address the comments in #1650 \r\n\r\nThis PR rewrite the documentation in `sig_stfl.h` header for a few APIs, make simpler and (somewhat) easier to read. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
