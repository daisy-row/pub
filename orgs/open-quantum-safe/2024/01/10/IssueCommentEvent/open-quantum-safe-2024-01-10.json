The AVX2 CT tests and `oqs-provider` tests were all green, but the \"generic\" CT tests had failures for McEliece, Sphincs+, and BIKE. The BIKE failures were expected, since they were patched after 0.9.0. I haven't yet looked through the McEliece and Sphincs+ failures, but it could well be that they are known issues that we've only documented in the AVX2 implementations, since [we haven't properly run the \"generic\" tests on those algorithms in a while](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1618). (Ever?)\r\n\r\nMy position is that we ought to go ahead with 0.9.2 regardless. Both Sphincs+ and McEliece currently have documented constant-time \"issues\" in our `constant_time` folder, and the current state of the algorithms is no worse than it was for 0.9.0 or 0.9.1.

Does this PR otherwise change an API?

There are still a few non-commented `/ KYBER_Q` operations remaining in the source code, but as far as I can tell all of these have constant dividends.\r\n\r\nSince that wouldn't catch the case where a division operation involving `KYBER_Q` was broken onto multiple lines, I also ran `grep -r 'KYBER_Q' src/kem/kyber` and manually scanned the results for partial expressions.
