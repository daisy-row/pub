If that happens, we have to change the `liboqs` code anyway. The work effort for all downstreams would be significantly eased if we use the final name already now, though: They (incl. \"us\" as in oqsprovider, etc.) at most need recompilation but no re-writing.\r\n\r\nI always thought `liboqs` aims to aid in the adoption of PQC and not force all users to follow the nitty-gritty details of the standardization process. Wouldn't it be nice if people could rely on `liboqs` (as any changes during further standardization steps are kept under the hood)? I personally consider(ed) that one big advantage of using this library: All tests, use cases, documentation, papers could be retained throughout the NIST competition (for those algorithms that didn't change names or got dropped). Why drop this advantage now that final names are agreed-upon?\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-25T15:27:08Z","updated_at":"2024-01-25T15:27:08Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1626#discussion_r1466541587","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1626","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1466541587"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1626#discussion_r1466541587"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1626"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1466541587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":74,"original_line":74,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1466286128,"original_position":5,"position":5,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1626","id":1640764242,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5hzBNS","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1626","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1626.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1626.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1626","number":1626,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Add ML-DSA-ipd and ML-KEM-ipd & NIST supplied test vectors","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Pull ML-DSA-ipd / ML-KEM-ipd from pq-crystals \"standard\" branch.\r\nAdds test cases with NIST supplied test vectors: https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization/example-files (see also _Note on the intermediate values for ML-KEM:_ and _Note on the intermediate values for ML-DSA:_)\r\n\r\nThe NIST files are rather large (several MB) and we only use parts of the data that can be passed via the public API + randomness.

values for ML-DSA:_)\r\n\r\nThe NIST files are rather large (several MB) and we only use parts of the data that can be passed via the public API + randomness. So we process them and store only the data we need in `tests/PQC_Intermediate_Values` (script is included to reproduce the files)\r\n\r\nThe PR adds new test code vectors_sig.c and vectors_kem.c that for testing the NIST vectors.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to keep the current Kyber/Dilithium (round 3) versions for compatibility reasons, and add the ML-* algorithms additionally.\r\n\r\nThe naming of the algorithms is done following the IETF hackathon: ML-DSA-44-ipd, ML-DSA-65-ipd, ML-DSA-87-ipd, ML-KEM-512-ipd, ML-KEM-768-ipd, ML-KEM-1024-ipd: https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates/blob/master/docs/oid_mapping.md\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [x] Add NIST supplied test vectors and code to test them\r\n- [x] Compact NIST test vectors: the files are quite large and we need only a small part of the value\r\n- [x] Pull ML-DSA-ipd from pq-crystals \"standard\" branch\r\n- [x] Pull ML-KEM-ipd from pq-crystals \"standard\" branch\r\n- [x] add patches for copy_from_upstream (for renaming to ML-KEM-ipd / ML-DSA-ipd)\r\n- [ ] ~~Pull pqclean aarch64 code (may omit for now)~~\r\n- [x] Integrate tests with CI\r\n- [x] Update docs\r\n- [x] Ensure updating to latest upstream versions (e.g. with Kyberslash fixes)\r\n- [x] Run constant-time tests on new algorithms & update valgrind files\r\n\r\nCloses #1521.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
