But would it still be possible to use the implemented hybrid schemes between pqc and classic algorithms (forex ample kyber and elliptic curves)?\r\n\r\nThanks, Sebastian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-01-25T14:41:07Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
