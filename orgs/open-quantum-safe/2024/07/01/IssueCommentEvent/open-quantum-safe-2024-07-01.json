For example in case of Kyber/ML-KEM one can do a workaround roughly like this in oqs-provider's oqsx_key_op function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if (strcmp(key->tls_name, \"mlkem1024\") == 0) {\r\n                memcpy(key->pubkey, (char *)key->privkey + 1536,\r\n                       key->pubkeylen);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea for this issue is that liboqs could provide a unified interface for recreating the public key from the private key, when it is possible. For example, a function like this could be added to kem.h in liboqs:\r\n\r\n`OQS_API OQS_STATUS OQS_KEM_recreate_pub_from_priv(const OQS_KEM *kem, uint8_t *secret_key, uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAnd in the OQS_KEM structure, for each algorithm a new function could be registered:\r\n\r\n`OQS_STATUS (*recreate)(const uint8_t *secret_key, const uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAdding this functionality could reduce serialized key sizes for some algorithms. This is a rough idea and I just want to ask for the opinions of the folks involved in oqs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2200204785","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802#issuecomment-2200204785","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802","id":2200204785,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c6DJHXx","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-01T13:46:01Z","updated_at":"2024-07-01T13:46:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Cross-reference to a [related OpenSSL issue FYI](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/16267)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2200204785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-01T13:46:02Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
