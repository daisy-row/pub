This is a more typical `git merge` in that we retain both parents and their commit histories. This will make future merges more straightforward by allowing git to notice the shared history and avoid marking these merged commits as conflicting changes. For the maintainers, make sure to merge using the default \"Merge Pull Request\" button. I tested this on my own fork and seems to be the only one of Github's options that preserves the history.\r\n\r\nHere's the git-foo used to script the merge and handle the false positives from the \"squash merges\".\r\n\r\n```\r\noqs_tip=OQS-v8\r\nopenssh_release=V_9_7_P1\r\ngit merge ${openssh_release}\r\nbase=`git merge-base ${oqs_tip} ${openssh_release}`\r\nfor f in `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`; do\r\n  # This fetches all of the commits which touched the file since the merge base\r\n  # Filter out the two commits for the 8.6 and 8.9 merges since they are technically already incorporated\r\n  conflicts=$(git log --oneline ${base}..${oqs_tip} -- $f | ggrep -v -P '(1f58edd59|f058d3168)')\r\n  # Check if we have no OQS-OpenSSH conflicts specific\r\n  if [[ -z ${conflicts} ]]; then\r\n    echo \"$f has no conflicts\"\r\n    # Resolve the conflict by taking the upstream version of the file\r\n    git checkout --theirs -- $f\r\n    git add $f\r\n  else\r\n    echo \"$f has conflicts\"\r\n    echo ${conflicts}\r\n    # Send all of the OQS diffs to a file to help resolve the merge conflicts\r\n    for c in `echo ${conflicts} | cut -d ' ' -f1`; do\r\n      git show $c -- $f >> ~/conflicting_diffs.t\r\n    done\r\n  fi\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the remaining conflicts, I went through each file one-by-one with this pseudo-algorithm:\r\n1. Incorporate all changes from both sides that have no direct conflicts.\r\n2. Look for OQS specific changes with conflicts and apply them as-appropriate.\r\n3. Take the upstream version for any remaining conflicts.\r\n\r\nCallouts from this process:\r\n- `sshkey.c` and `sshkey.h` experienced a major refactor upstream that impacted how OQS modified these files. I simply took the upstream versions for now and plan to address the conflict properly in a separate PR.\r\n- Kept `README.md` as-is from OQS and applied changes to `README.original.md`.\r\n- Took `.depend` from upstream, will update in a subsequent commit.\r\n- `version.h` retained the 2022-01 datestamp from OQS, will update this when we're ready to stage a release.\r\n- In `ssh-keygen.c` the `OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_PRINT_RESOURCE_RECORDS_START` template changed to accept two additional arguments `opts` and `nopts`. I added these in manually for now.\r\n\r\nTo self-check I did the following:\r\n- Test build by running `build_openssh.sh` and finding compiler errors.\r\n- Run `git diff HEAD V_9_7_P1` to highlight all the changes and assert that all changes were introduced by OQS alone.\r\n\r\nThis last process flagged a handful of issues. Mostly around duplicated code blocks from taking them from previous upstream merges and this current merge and git not noticing it. With that out of the way, I'm reasonably confident that this PR is pretty close to upstream v9.7 with only the changes from OQS applied to it.\r\n\r\nSo after all that, what's working so far? `build_openssh.sh` will build the project but fail to install with some error about unknown key types. The failure I had locally is the same one reported by the CI job.\r\n\r\nWhat's next?\r\n- Properly handle the merge conflicts in `sshkey.(c|h)`.\r\n- Regenerate `.depend`.\r\n- Fix the impacted OQS templates and regenerate the source.\r\n- Cut a new `OQS-v9` branch and update `version.h`.","created_at":"2024-06-24T18:26:53Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T21:03:24Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da59326f8395901e98c15d7fcb9c513968650ef3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/statuses/7563a7cb26e0e6b4f10f79f7489cdf6aa4d27eab","head":{"label":"geedo0:merge-ossh97","ref":"merge-ossh97","sha":"7563a7cb26e0e6b4f10f79f7489cdf6aa4d27eab","user":{"login":"geedo0","id":7552310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTIzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7552310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0","html_url":"https://github.com/geedo0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":819545415,"node_id":"R_kgDOMNlFRw","name":"openssh","full_name":"geedo0/openssh","private":false,"owner":{"login":"geedo0","id":7552310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTIzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7552310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0","html_url":"https://github.com/geedo0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/geedo0/openssh","description":"Fork of OpenSSH that includes prototype quantum-resistant key exchange and authentication in SSH based on liboqs.
