as an alternative, and for testing, the following can be added in .vscode settings:\r\n```\r\n    \"json.schemas\": [\r\n        \r\n\r\n        {\r\n            \"fileMatch\": [\r\n                \"cbom.json\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/CBOM/main/bom-1.4-cbom-1.0.schema.json\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Cyclone DX 1.6\r\n\r\nCBOM is now incorporated into CycloneDX 1.6, but here the schema as evolved a little\r\n\r\nWe can validate against the [new spec](http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.6.schema.json) - the example below includes the vscode definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"json.schemas\": [\r\n\r\n\r\n        {\r\n            \"fileMatch\": [\r\n                \"cbom.json\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"url\": \"http://cyclonedx.org/schema/bom-1.6.schema.json\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `$schema` is included in the bom, then other tools wouldn't need to explicitly be configured, and should find the schema definition automatically\r\n\r\nIn CycloneDX 1.6 the following is noted:\r\n\r\n* ` \"bomFormat\": \"CBOM\",` -> can only be 'CycloneDX'\r\n* `\"type\": \"crypto-asset\",` -> 'cryptographic-asset'\r\n* In `algorithmProperties`, `variant` & `implementationLevel` are not allowed. where the last segment of Variant includes a platform like `x86_64` this probably is now best matched to `implementationPlatform` , whilst `implementationLevel` is `executionEnvironment`\r\n* in `cryptoProperties`, `nistQuantumSecurityLevel` is not allowed - it has moved under `algorithmProperties`\r\n* `\"primitive\": \"blockcipher\",` -> `block-cipher`\r\n* \"dependencyType\": \"uses\" - not allowed. there is a new property `provides` which seems to make sense where an algorithm is provided, whilst just having a dependency presumes uses ..?\r\n\r\nNote the above is from a quick scan - need to check in more detail...\r\n\r\n@bhess @dstebila I think it would be useful to consider this update now that the 1.6 spec is out, and we're seeing more tooling support CBOM.\r\n\r\nHappy to work on some updates if it's helpful -
