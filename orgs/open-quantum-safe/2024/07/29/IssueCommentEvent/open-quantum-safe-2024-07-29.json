Instead, it's automatically set by CMake depending on whether or not pthreads is available.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please let me know how you observed/measured the thread contention?\r\n\r\nMy machine tested has 12 cores, and the test unit is Tps, that is, how many times it is run per second. When executing a single thread, the measured performance of kyber512 encryption is 27000Tps, but when executing 12 threads, the performance does not increase, which seems to be abnormal. It is said that multi-threading has higher performance than single-threading. Why does the above situation occur? Or, how should I configure it so that the performance of multi-threaded testing will be higher than that of single-threaded testing?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2254767134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-29T01:21:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

We need to update the algorithms supported in the OpenSSH OQS fork back in line.\r\n\r\nI went through the two lists by hand to identify all the mismatches since the last time these algorithms were updated. I can use some help from the maintainers as to how these newer algorithms should be brought into OpenSSH. Some specific questions off the top of my head:\r\n- If they should be brought in at all.\r\n- How they should be named/renamed.\r\n- Hybrid/Hash pairing for the algorithms.\r\n\r\nListing of algorithms that exist in liboqs, but not in OpenSSH and some initial notes/thoughts:\r\n- [BIKE Round-4](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/a1bdce98949a228269abcd65727d1093706ba13c)\r\n  * Adds a new parameter set `BIKE-L5`.\r\n  * Existing KEX names are qualified with `r3` and need to be updated.\r\n- [ML-KEM and ML-DSA IPD](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/60adf53107885b3e4ff71864683c472bc561ff89)\r\n  * Forthcoming NIST standards for Kyber/Dilithium.\r\n  * Follow conventions set by the pre-NIST implementation?\r\n  * Some names/pairings are proposed [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke/)\r\n  * The security levels in the draft RFC do not align on the security levels which is the convention followed by the OQS library\r\n  * The draft RFC uses x25519, need to figure out how to wire that up.\r\n  * The IPD version exists in OQS and an alias without the IPD qualifier is provided.\r\n- [sntrup761](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1328)\r\n  * This would allow interop with upstream OpenSSH\r\n  * Also would conflict with upstream OpenSSH implementation\r\n  * Upstream name `sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com`\r\n- [Falcon PADDED format](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/7e5dbaf2e88e2c374e0cd290195567c182031284)\r\n  * Existing KEX uses the COMPRESSED format.\r\n- [MAYO](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/4cc88845e8bb66dca20cd61ff88c2162f38c3230)\r\n  * New signature algorithm\r\n- XMSS and LMS\r\n  * Stateful algorithms not suitable for SSH signatures.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/2256016179","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/163#issuecomment-2256016179","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/163","id":2256016179,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV86GeBMz","user":{"login":"geedo0","id":7552310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTIzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7552310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0","html_url":"https://github.com/geedo0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-29T13:55:20Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T13:55:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, that's exactly the goal I had in mind.

The reason is the Kyber-512's security level is considered less than 128-bits and those that want to be conservative chose Kyber768 as the default. Drafts [draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00) and [draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-kyber](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-kyber) got assigned temporary codepoints for ECDH with Kyber768 combinations. These are supported in OQS OpenSSL already I believe.\r\n\r\nI think this can be the sane strategy for a temporary IANA codepoint for SSH on top of the temporary, \"arbitrary\" ones in [draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke) we are all have coded to. \r\n\r\nSo, after we have the first draft spec of Kyber768, we would like to add support for P256-Kyber768 by using a \"permanent temporary\" IANA registry codepoint. This codepoint can live forever until we get the final final spec. At that point we will not need the codepoint any more, but it can still be supported until everyone migrates. This is the approach TLS is taking as well. \r\n\r\nWe would like to have OQS OpenSSH support this codepoint as the defacto PQ OpenSSH library. Otherwise there is no reason to support it on our own. \r\n\r\nAny interest in adding support for a \"temporary permanent\" P256+Kyber768 codepoint?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/2256081117","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145#issuecomment-2256081117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145","id":2256081117,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV86GeRDd","user":{"login":"geedo0","id":7552310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTIzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7552310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0","html_url":"https://github.com/geedo0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-29T14:21:21Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T14:21:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@csosto-pk, can we close this issue in favor of Issue #163?
