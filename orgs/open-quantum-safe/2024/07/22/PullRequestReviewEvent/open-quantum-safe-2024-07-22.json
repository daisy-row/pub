I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

This broke the build/tests and obviously the ability to use PQ SSH keys. This PR restores PQ SSH key support for \"pure\" PQ algorithms. A follow-up PR will bring back support for hybrid-PQ. This was done to break up the PRs and do things more incrementally.\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, there was a major refactor of `sshkey` upstream which moved algorithm implementations to an OOP abstraction via the `sshkey_impl` struct. This allowed them to get rid of all the switch statements, encapsulate algorithm specific code, and standardize on a single factory method to get the right implementation. Some other minor things like the function signatures for sign/verify were updated to accept new optional arguments.\r\n\r\nGetting OQS over to this new system was a matter of defining these `sshkey_impl` structs and factoring out the relevant OQS bits to the proper functions. This involved a number of changes/renames/deletions to the templates. I also performed a 3-way merge to pull-in changes that weren't directly impacted by the refactor.\r\n\r\nThere is no support for hybrid SSH Key support for now. This is to make sure that the baseline refactor is in a good shape before committing to a certain path. To support hybrid, I propose implementing generic hybrid versions of these classes. The only tricky thing is figuring out how to expose the RSA/EC implementations to the `ssh-oqs` file (probably declaring externs?). I considered doing this \"on the outside\", but that seems to go against what the refactor aimed to do and adds a lot more complexity to the sshkey source than seems necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat's working now?\r\n- `build_openssh.sh` now compiles and installs successfully 🎉\r\n- CI passes as long as tests for the missing hybrid SSH key support is skipped.\r\n- Upstream OpenSSH CI and `make tests` target fail, but these are to be pre-existing defects.\r\n\r\nRelated to Issue

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the
