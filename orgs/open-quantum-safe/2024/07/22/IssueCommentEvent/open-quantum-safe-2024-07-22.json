This broke the build/tests and obviously the ability to use PQ SSH keys. This PR restores PQ SSH key support for \"pure\" PQ algorithms. A follow-up PR will bring back support for hybrid-PQ. This was done to break up the PRs and do things more incrementally.\r\n\r\nAt a high-level, there was a major refactor of `sshkey` upstream which moved algorithm implementations to an OOP abstraction via the `sshkey_impl` struct. This allowed them to get rid of all the switch statements, encapsulate algorithm specific code, and standardize on a single factory method to get the right implementation. Some other minor things like the function signatures for sign/verify were updated to accept new optional arguments.\r\n\r\nGetting OQS over to this new system was a matter of defining these `sshkey_impl` structs and factoring out the relevant OQS bits to the proper functions. This involved a number of changes/renames/deletions to the templates. I also performed a 3-way merge to pull-in changes that weren't directly impacted by the refactor.\r\n\r\nThere is no support for hybrid SSH Key support for now. This is to make sure that the baseline refactor is in a good shape before committing to a certain path. To support hybrid, I propose implementing generic hybrid versions of these classes. The only tricky thing is figuring out how to expose the RSA/EC implementations to the `ssh-oqs` file (probably declaring externs?). I considered doing this \"on the outside\", but that seems to go against what the refactor aimed to do and adds a lot more complexity to the sshkey source than seems necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat's working now?\r\n- `build_openssh.sh` now compiles and installs successfully 🎉\r\n- CI passes as long as tests for the missing hybrid SSH key support is skipped.\r\n- Upstream OpenSSH CI and `make tests` target fail, but these are to be pre-existing defects.\r\n\r\nRelated to Issue #135","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/160/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/2243070110","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pull/160#issuecomment-2243070110","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/160","id":2243070110,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV86Fsoie","user":{"login":"geedo0","id":7552310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTIzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7552310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0","html_url":"https://github.com/geedo0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geedo0/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-22T14:13:41Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T14:13:41Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Can we merge the PR (I don't have permissions to do this) or are we waiting on more feedback or testing?

What's the preferred format for submitting these diagrams? (Mermaid code, PNG, or both?)\r\n2. Are there any specific style guidelines I should follow for consistency with existing documentation?\r\n3. Where in the docs would these diagrams be most beneficial?\r\n\r\nI'm happy to submit a PR to contribute these diagrams to the project once I have some guidance on the above questions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2243691451","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1851#issuecomment-2243691451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1851","id":2243691451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c6FvAO7","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-22T19:45:22Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T19:45:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Putting this into the Wiki (or making the Wiki a separate repo) seems suboptimal for me. IMO this should be/remain in lockstep with the code and reside in the code's repo, best arguably in the doc folder -- which needs some new container to \"house\" this in. What about moving the Wiki augmented with the graph to a new docs/examples folder?\r\n\r\nWe do have tests/examples_*.c, but maybe these would be better relocated into a new docs/examples folder, with the extra materials you're suggesting?\r\n\r\n> Edit/add: Further benefit of housing this in the docs folder --if I'm not mistaken-- is that this would automatically wind up on the Web site that way, making bespoke 'www' code unnecessary, right, @dstebila ?\r\n\r\nWe'd still need to edit the www code to pull in the relevant parts into the website template, but after that's done once the updates would be automatically pulled in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2243691451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-22T19:45:23Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
