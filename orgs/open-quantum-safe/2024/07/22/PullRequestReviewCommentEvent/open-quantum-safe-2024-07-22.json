I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file.

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects.

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1795.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
