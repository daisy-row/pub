I've left it in draft for now as it's based on the branch for #1848.\r\n\r\nI have tried to duplicate the testing coverage from CircleCI without additions or removals. This PR isn't intended to overhaul or evaluate our test coverage, it's just meant to move it to a different platform.\r\n\r\nThree items of note:\r\n\r\n(1) The CCI [`bionic-i386`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/.circleci/config.yml#L297) could not be ported over, as the GitHub `checkout` action requires a newer version of `node` and can't run in the older container (at least not without some finicky work). Bionic is no longer supported anyhow, so it's probably for the best that we're no longer using it for testing. However, the multiarch images that we'd been using don't have options for i386 past Bionic, so there is no easy way to continue testing on i386. We don't list Linux / x86 as a [supported platform](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/60cd3d83c92ae2679df3460955921570a6e0f05d/PLATFORMS.md), so I've opted to simply remove CI support for it.\r\n\r\n(2) The CCI `focal-clang-15` job had `-DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake` set. It didn't configure `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF`, however, so the opt target value was ignored. I have omitted the opt target variable in GitHub CI to reflect what was actually being tested.\r\n\r\n(3) Finally, @ryjones helped me add a CircleCI API token to the liboqs environment so that GitHub can trigger CircleCI for downstream projects. These triggers are contained in the new `commit-to-main.yml` file. We may want to revise them for completeness, but for now I have left them as they were on CCI.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
