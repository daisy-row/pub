Dare I ask how extensive your LF experience is as\r\n\r\n> In my experience, the LF always advocates for open governance, which means they dictate guidelines but every project organizes its own.\r\n\r\nthis is not what I've witnessed so far: I experienced LF (staff) enforcing mechanisms that projects then have to cope with. GOVERNANCE.md and CODEOWNERS files are disregarded and community members, incl. maintainers have to beg for permissions -- provided they know which ones are needed and justifiable (i.e., might get granted).\r\n\r\n>     oqs-provider: The CODEOWNERS file (oqs-provider/.github/CODEOWNERS) simply lists:\r\n>    * @baentsch \r\n\r\nThat's indeed a problem I'm trying (probably failing) to get across to the LF staff: oqsprovider indeed is \"special\" in that it is a project I created and still \"own\" (last edited/have to review) about 80% of all running code and 95% of all generator code thus leaving me with 100% of (what I understand to be as) maintenance obligations. Removing all GH admin privileges under such conditions does create _lots of_ friction (and frustration and de-motivation). \r\n\r\nNo doubt, the project could benefit from refactoring (see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/375), e.g., to split out hybrid KEM and composite SIG code sections (the main non-@baentsch code pieces), also to make CODEOWNERS more granular (and create a wider base of support). Grateful to @thb-sb to be willing to take a stab at that.\r\n\r\n> liboqs: The CODEOWNERS file\r\n\r\nThis file also needs an update as it doesn't reflect current contribution levels and recent additions. Thanks for highlighting it! Created https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1843 to fix/track.\r\n\r\n> The release friction sounds like a significant concern that needs attention\r\n\r\nI don't think so: a) I [documented how contributors can do releases](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/wiki/Release-process) and b) @ryjones pointed to examples as to how I might request required permissions to do things more easily. However, I don't know which those would be as I don't know what are all the things expected of me. And I'm too old (i.e., consider my time is too short :) to keep coming back begging for permissions every time I receive another statement (from LF staff) \"we expect maintainers to xyz\".\r\n\r\nSo this is what this issue is all about: Have one place where contributors and maintainers can understand what in this LF-controlled project they are expected (and in consequence will be permitted) to do. \r\n\r\nIf you'd know of such \"maintainer & contributor obligations\" (that are used/accepted in the \"LF-verse\"), please by all means, share them here @anvega : It surely would help me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2233491485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-17T14:39:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n[No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?
