That was my intention in #1603 but I didn't realize that `<oqs/aes.h>` and co. are moved to internal-only and no longer installed.

That was my intention in #1603 but I didn't realize that `<oqs/aes.h>` and co. are moved to internal-only and no longer installed.

Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of
