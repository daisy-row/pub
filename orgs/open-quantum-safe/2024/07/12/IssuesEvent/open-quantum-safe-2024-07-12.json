Now that we have the ability to set callbacks, could we get rid of the `C_OR_NI_OR_ARM` macros and instead set the callbacks once (either during library init, or alternatively on first use if it's not set)?  Again: not something to do in this PR, but if anyone else thinks it might be good, we could create a separate issue to track.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dstebila in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1707#discussion_r1674441978_\r\n\r\nSee also: #1599, #1832\r\n            ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-12T13:11:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
