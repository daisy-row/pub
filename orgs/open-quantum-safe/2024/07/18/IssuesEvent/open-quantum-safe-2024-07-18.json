Also note that the number of targets built is greater in the first case (127) than in the second (101).\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe `cmake -LA ..` call should have no side effects.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 22.04\r\n - OpenSSL version: 3.0.2\r\n - Compiler version used: GCC 11.4.0\r\n - Build variables used: see above\r\n - liboqs version: `main`, at commit 5670edf59fa7a910654b9171229b7dc1ea7ece4c\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe use this pattern [basically everywhere](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/4cc88845e8bb66dca20cd61ff88c2162f38c3230/.github/workflows/unix.yml#L147) in CI to print config variables, so the bug's impact could have been huge. Thankfully, it looks like there were no failures hidden by the bug. [This branch](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/sw-cmake-la) removes all occurrences of `cmake -LA ..` from CI, and everything passes. Based on some [older](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1618) [investigation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1666), I think we can infer that the weekly tests are unaffected as well.\r\n\r\nI believe that the issue lies in our filtering logic when an option like `OQS_MINIMAL_BUILD` or `OQS_ALGS_ENABLED` is set. I'll investigate further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-18T19:59:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
