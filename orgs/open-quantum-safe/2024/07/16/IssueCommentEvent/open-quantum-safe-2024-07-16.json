July 12, 2024 - Nicola/Pravek/Spencer\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nNicola Tuveri ([@romen](https://github.com/romen) on GitHub) is a doctoral researcher at Tampere University, with a focus on side channel attacks.\r\nHe is also an OpenSSL Committer and a member of the OpenSSL Technical Committee (OTC).\r\nEarlier this year, he made an academic visit to Waterloo.\r\nDouglas, Pravek, and I had the pleasure of getting to know him and having conversations about his research, OpenSSL, and OQS.\r\n\r\nIn recent discussions about a threat model for `liboqs`, the [OpenSSL threat model](https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/security-policy.html) has been mentioned frequently, particularly in contrast with WolfSSL's threat model.\r\nOpenSSL considers fault attacks (and generally physical attacks) to be out of scope, whereas WolfSSL does not.\r\n\r\nI asked Nicola if he could provide insight into the rationale behind OpenSSL's decision to exclude fault attacks from their threat model.\r\nI also solicited general advice and guidance on developing OQS threat model(s).\r\nHe graciously set up a call with Pravek and me to discuss these matters.\r\nThis document is based on the notes I took during that call.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nNicola made it clear that he was speaking in a personal capacity, not on behalf of OpenSSL.\r\nEverything here is based on his opinions and speculation and should not be considered to be representative of OpenSSL in any way.\r\nAdditionally, although the OTC is in charge of the security policy, it inherited an existing policy when it (the committee) was created.\r\nNicola was not involved in the process of creating the security policy and indeed would have had a conflict of interest, as his academic research involves attacks that fall outside the threat model.\r\n\r\n## OpenSSL Security Policy\r\n\r\nOpenSSL's rationale in excluding fault attacks and other attacks that require same physical system access goes back to a larger discussion about user protection vs user responsibility.\r\nThe position of OpenSSL developers has shifted over time.\r\nOriginally (going back to 1998), their stance was that OpenSSL was a toolkit with which users could do whatever they liked, and they should not get in the way of experimentation.\r\nAs OpenSSL became a critical component in many production systems, its devs pivoted toward protecting users more, with the burden of maintaining legacy compatibility.\r\n\r\nAttacks that require local access were excluded because they typically require gaining elevated privileges, sometimes to the point of compromising the application running OpenSSL.\r\nIn these cases, there is often an easier and more direct attack vector than targeting OpenSSL.\r\nOpenSSL's reasoning here is similar to their reasoning for considering attacks resulting from parse errors in trusted (e.g., private key) files to be out of scope: if a user cannot trust their own private key file, than something has gone horribly wrong long before hitting an OpenSSL parsing bug.\r\n\r\nWhen OpenSSL receives a disclosure of an out-of-scope attack, they will typically not issue a CVE themselves.\r\nThey sometimes direct the reporter to another vendor (e.g., Intel) which may issue a CVE.\r\nFor out-of-scope attacks, OpenSSL is not required to include hardening measures, but they may do so anyway after considering impacts of the changes on performance, usability, etc.\r\nGenerally, mitigations are included, sometimes as non-default options, unless there is a significant impact to performance, backward compatibility, etc.\r\nThis applies when the reporters include a suggested mitigation: sometimes neither this nor a proof-of-concept exploit is provided.\r\nOpenSSL typically requests proof-of-concept exploits and countermeasures if they are not included in the initial report.\r\n\r\nSometimes, a local physical access attack does not require elevated privileges.\r\nFor example, in a cloud data centre an attacker might obtain a VM on the same machine that is running the target application.\r\nWhen a reporter argues that such an attack is possible, OpenSSL typically asks for a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of a remote exploit.\r\n\r\n### Comparison With WolfSSL\r\n\r\nNicola speculates that WolfSSL took a different approach to same-physical-system attacks because their targets included embedded and resource-constrained systems.\r\nCertification and validation on these systems often requires resistance to such attacks.\r\nAdditionally, WolfSSL is often used in firmware, without an OS, as opposed to OpenSSL, which is exclusively intended for software with a full OS.\r\nSame-physical-system attacks are often viewed as targeting the OS first and OpenSSL second.\r\n\r\n## Notes for OQS\r\n\r\nNicola suggested that OQS would need separate threat models for each project, which might refer to each other.\r\nFor example, `oqs-provider` might have its own threat model for the \"glue\" between `liboqs` and OpenSSL, but its overall threat model would be limited by the `liboqs` threat model.\r\nMany security reports for `oqs-provider` would likely be forwarded to `liboqs`.\r\nSimilarly, some reports to `liboqs` would be forwarded to non-OQS projects such as PQ-Crystals.\r\n\r\nNicola also suggested that it might be worth collecting documentation for the threat models of various upstream sources and presenting this information in `liboqs` instead of making general claims about all of the `liboqs` source code.\r\nHe also noted that, regardless of our intentions, `liboqs` source code may end up in embedded systems simply because it is the most well-known and easy to find source for post-quantum cryptographic code.\r\n\r\nFinally, Nicola expressed a willingness to sit in on future OQS threat model-focused meetings if it would be helpful for us, conditional on his availability.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2229887150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-16T02:34:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Installed nginx using this: \r\n\r\n                    -    wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.23.4.tar.gz \r\n                    \r\n                    -    tar -xzvf nginx-1.23.4.tar.gz \r\n                     \r\n                    -   cd nginx-1.23.4 \r\n                     \r\n                    -  ./configure --with-openssl=/path/to/your/openssl --with-http_ssl_module \r\n                     \r\n                    -    make \r\n                     \r\n                    -    sudo make install \r\n\r\n3. Added following line in the nginx-conf file located in /usr/local/nginx/conf \r\n\r\n                    -          ssl_certificate /home/amit/Desktop/server.crt; \r\n                    \r\n                    -          ssl_certificate_key /home/amit/Desktop/server.key; \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhenever I am using normal rsa certificate in place of server.crt this “openssl s_client -connect localhost:443” command is working well and good  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4. But if I replace the server.crt and server.csr with dilithium3 certificate then nginx is not even loading with error: \r\n\r\n“nginx: [emerg] SSL_CTX_use_certificate(\"/home/amit/Desktop/dilithium3_srv.crt\") failed (SSL: error:03000072:digital envelope routines::decode error error:0A00018F:SSL routines::ee key too small)” \r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me how to overcome this issue.

A self-assessment by project maintainers, covering:\r\n    -  Project design goals and scope (similar to the discussion above on what's in and out of scope)\r\n    -  System actors and actions\r\n    -  Potential risks in design and configuration implementations\r\n2. Review by third-party security volunteers to provide additional perspectives and validation (We maintain a roster of security experts for this purpose. This review is similar to the engagement of a code audit but focuses more on overall architecture and design principles, rather than being tied to a specific release. It provides a broader architectural assessment that'd expect from a threat model.)\r\n3. Then the joint group of project team and security volunteers create lightweight threat models and attack matrices based on this collaborative process\r\n\r\nThis approach balances thoroughness with practicality. We've documented it in a guidebook (https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/assessments/Open_and_Secure.pdf) and guidelines (https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md). To date, 35 projects have gone through this process or collaborated with us on it.\r\n\r\nExamples of outcomes:\r\n* in-toto project: https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/assessments/projects/in-toto/self-assessment.md\r\n* SPIFFE/SPIRE projects: https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/assessments/projects/spiffe-spire/self-assessment.md\r\n* SPIFFE/SPIRE projects Attack Matrix: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M2AgqBQTlZSfCL7La2Kz8KhD1M17rbV_OJZN_POQVGg\r\n\r\nThis approach, or elements of it, could potentially be adapted for liboqs and oqsprovider. As OQS is part of the PQCA, this might present an opportunity for collaboration between maintainers of other Linux Foundation projects, leveraging security practitioners' expertise.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss further in an upcoming meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2231499110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-16T17:58:36Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

This approach differs from other LF projects, where CODEOWNERS are often defined in settings.yml and config.yaml files, and tools like [CLOWarden](https://github.com/cncf/clowarden) For example:\r\n- OQS TSC: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/blob/923acd7cf661e08e9a40031aa1a879d0d6fe8ff1/config.yaml\r\n- PQCA: https://github.com/PQCA/governance/blob/main/config.yaml\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the LF always advocates for open governance, which means every project dictates its own. However, it seems there are different approaches being used across the repositories, which could be a point of consideration when defining a consistent governance structure.\r\n\r\nThe release friction is a significant concern that needs immediate attention.
