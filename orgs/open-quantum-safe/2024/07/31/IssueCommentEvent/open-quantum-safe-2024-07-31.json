Installed nginx using this: \r\n\r\n                    -    wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.23.4.tar.gz \r\n                    \r\n                    -    tar -xzvf nginx-1.23.4.tar.gz \r\n                     \r\n                    -   cd nginx-1.23.4 \r\n                     \r\n                    -  ./configure --with-openssl=/path/to/your/openssl --with-http_ssl_module \r\n                     \r\n                    -    make \r\n                     \r\n                    -    sudo make install \r\n\r\n3. Added following line in the nginx-conf file located in /usr/local/nginx/conf \r\n\r\n                    -          ssl_certificate /home/amit/Desktop/server.crt; \r\n                    \r\n                    -          ssl_certificate_key /home/amit/Desktop/server.key; \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhenever I am using normal rsa certificate in place of server.crt this “openssl s_client -connect localhost:443” command is working well and good  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4. But if I replace the server.crt and server.csr with dilithium3 certificate then nginx is not even loading with error: \r\n\r\n“nginx: [emerg] SSL_CTX_use_certificate(\"/home/amit/Desktop/dilithium3_srv.crt\") failed (SSL: error:03000072:digital envelope routines::decode error error:0A00018F:SSL routines::ee key too small)” \r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me how to overcome this issue.
