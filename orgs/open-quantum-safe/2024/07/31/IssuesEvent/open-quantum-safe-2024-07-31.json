Added following line in the nginx-conf file located in /usr/local/nginx/conf \r\n\r\n                    -          ssl_certificate /home/amit/Desktop/server.crt; \r\n                    \r\n                    -          ssl_certificate_key /home/amit/Desktop/server.key; \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhenever I am using normal rsa certificate in place of server.crt this “openssl s_client -connect localhost:443” command is working well and good  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.
