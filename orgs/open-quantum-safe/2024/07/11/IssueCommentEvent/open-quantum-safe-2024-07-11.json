Do you expect NIST to standardize APIs, @hartm? Can you please point to such intention? If so, the purpose of this project indeed remains \"experimental\" until NIST finalizes this. But then OQS should clearly state that its APIs shall not be considered reliable until the NIST standards are announced. I personally doubt NIST will mandate APIs, though, as that'd be a can of worms: Which languages would it support, say?\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of people with which I've spoken on PQC have said that they aren't planning on fully putting PQC into production until after the NIST standards are finalized.  \r\n\r\nNIST is not going to standardize APIs, of course, but they could change (or recommend changes) to minor things in protocols.\r\n\r\nYou are correct that OQS should state a policy on APIs for the sake of users.\r\n\r\n> I can understand you don't worry as you don't contribute or use liboqs afaik @hartm, but please consider the impact of API changes to a library others are/should be using --particularly if it has no formal LTS release done but strives for uptake as OQS does: This is not very friendly to all downstream users: I for one had been on the receiving end of API changes in many projects integrating this code and had to work long hours coping with such changes... This was one reason for me now wanting others to begin handling \"OQS-internal\" liboqs integrations, too, such as for them to experience this and give me support (getting stability and/or a hand in following the changes). And again, there may be more people using liboqs APIs, regardless or not of the project having declared an \"LTS\" version.\r\n\r\nWho is using OQS in production deployments?  And would they be upset at API changes?\r\n\r\nUltimately, as you allude, whether or not API changes go smoothly or not are mostly dependent on appropriate communication between maintainers/contributors and users.  The decision belongs to the maintainers/OQS TSC (certainly not me, and not the people who use and don't contribute either).  Some of these decisions can be complicated and involve weighing whether or not improving the project by improving the APIs is worth making life more difficult for a subset of the users.  \r\n\r\nI *do* generally worry about API changes, but 1) imagine that there aren't a lot of production deployments where these API changes would cause major grief (happy to be corrected here--please let me know if I'm wrong) and 2) am confident that API changes are better the earlier they are in a project's lifecycle.  As the project grows, it becomes harder and harder to make these kinds of changes.  So if it's something that's needed, it's better to do now rather than later.\r\n\r\nI hope all of this makes sense!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2222654090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-11T11:11:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Clearly no \"production deployment\" but a legitimate use -- that OQS explicitly wants to support. My goal is to minimize such \"inconvenience\" -- and as you rightly point out, this is a sign of a more mature project. So let me add that to the lifecycle document.\r\n\r\nIf I were doing research, I'd most likely just end up using the old version on short notice and not bother updating until after the paper deadline.  I don't think this would be a big issue.  I could just update later on.\r\n\r\nThe nightmare scenario is if the APIs get updated and someone has a production deployment where they use an old version (with the old APIs).  Now suppose there's a big security bug fix that needs to happen ASAP, but it's only deployed for the new version of the software.  Now this \"someone\" is in a lot of trouble because they would need to do a huge update on their software to deploy a security fix that needs to be deployed immediately.  This is the kind of scenario we'd like to avoid.\r\n\r\nWith all this in mind, it's still a good idea to include LTS/API support in a lifecycle document.  APIs *can* be changed by a mature project (and they are) but this should be telegraphed to the community well in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2223218258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-07-11T15:17:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
