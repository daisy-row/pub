Would it be conceivable to use an algorithm naming convention a bit more in line with what we've been using so far, i.e., either no or \"-\" (dash) name/strength separation? Reasons: 1) Easier to type; 2) easier to remember (for users accustomed to using other `liboqs` algs); 3) underscores require more backquotes (even in this PR); 4) in `oqsprovider` this breaks the convention that underscores separate classic from PQC algs... Or is the underscore an important feature for some reason?
