I've been playing around with this pr and I have a small feature request:\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to create a public facing function that given a public key byte string, you are able to get the name of the parameter set via the oid?\r\n\r\nThe use-case I'm looking at is I don't want to have to define a new algorithm ID for each of the XMSS parametersets liboqs offers. Instead I want to to define an algorithim id for XMSS and XMSS^MT in my user application and then figure out which parameter set is being used based off of the key. Looking at the XMSS codebase (I haven't checked LMS yet) it looks like all public keys and secret keys are prefixed with an oid.\r\n\r\nThe function would look something like\r\n```\r\nchar *OQS_SIG_STFL_name_from_public_key(unsigned char *pk)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2052543536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-12T21:17:07Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
