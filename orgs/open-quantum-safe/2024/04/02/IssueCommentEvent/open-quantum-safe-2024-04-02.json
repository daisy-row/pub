Google hasn't signed their commits, so forcing DCO will create problems when we update/merge upstream BoringSSL commits.\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > @ryjones Can you advise how to proceed on this?\r\n> \r\n> @dstebila When/where did we (you?) agree to activate DCO?\r\n\r\nDCO is part of the [OQS Technical Charter section 7.b.ii](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/blob/main/charter/charter-2024-01-03.pdf), so we agreed to it in principle when we moved the project in to the LF.  There wasn't a discussion about an explicit timeline on when to activate, so it seems to have been activated when Ry had some time to work through onboarding our various repositories. When he turned it on for liboqs, I did ask him to turn it back from a hard-fail to a soft-fail to give us a chance to adjust to the new workflow, but I don't think I asked for that soft-fail on all our repositories.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/comments/2033288721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-02T23:43:14Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
