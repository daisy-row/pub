Is it correct \"we\" agreed to the LF take over? I only went along the many \"we-never-do-it-like-this-at-LF\" statements with which my change requests to the LF contracts were nixed when you assured me that the technical work will continue unencumbered.\r\n\r\nSome of the Charter changes you requested were made, some were not; I don't recall all of them off the top of my head.  The OQS Technical Charter can be revised, so if there is something in the Charter that you would like to be changed at this point, then it can be raised as an agenda item with the TSC.\r\n\r\n>     2. Wouldn't it be prudent to clearly document and announce anything changing the contribution mechanics of an OSS project before activation? I think is is not reasonable to assume everyone will read the fine-print of an LF contract (section \"7.b.ii\" -- really?) when contributing.\r\n\r\nThis happened.  At my request, Ry sent an email to the oqs-tsc mailing list on March 12 announcing this planned change with some links to documentation explaining what the DCO change is and how to use it.\r\n\r\n>     3. Now that I read this fine-print, it also says \"through a TSC-approved process\": May I [reiterate the question](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1743#issuecomment-2033016269) where this process is documented and add the question when the TSC approved it? Little reminder to [Meeting minutes? tsc#7 (comment)](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/7#issuecomment-2013604331)\r\n\r\nI am not sure exactly what 'TSC-approved process' means in this context.  It could mean that -- while the charter requires the project to use DCO -- the TSC has discretion on the specific mechanism used to implement the collection of DCO sign-offs.  I'm not sure I see any value in trying to come up with another mechanism, the Charter does let the TSC take this on if we think it worthwhile.\r\n\r\n>     4. Why are some projects treated differently than others (\"soft fail\")? Conceptually, we have TSC issues ([1](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1), [2](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/2)) to discuss things like that. Again, when did this (discussion) happen? I have great sympathy for asking leniency regarding DCO to allow the most important OQS subproject to continue unencumbered lacking a thorough understanding what this LF process would mean for contributors, but I consider this a questionable approach: Wouldn't it be more sensible to openly communicate changes first, then openly discuss and agree them and only activate them after everyone had a chance to weigh in and adapt? One more topic for the [discussion on project openness](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1731).\r\n\r\nI've gone back in my email thread, and it appears I was mistaken when I said that my soft-fail request was about liboqs specifically.  Ry's email of March 12 says that he had enabled DCO checks in the CI, but turned off the branch protection rules to mandate that for the time being -- and this was not limited to liboqs, as far as I know.  The closing line of his March 12 email is \"I will work with the community to enable this on all repos in the next few weeks.\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/comments/2035604635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-03T21:13:53Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
