for this bisect. Kind of expected this as this commit started asking providers for add'l sigalgs. So it could well be that the mere presence of unknown sigalg code points announced in the handshake make these servers \"cringe\" as already suggested by @levitte . If it only were a problem of the number of sigalgs, well try disabling all but one in the config .yml... Should the problem remain, change the remaining code point to a known one and if it works then, we know it's unknown sigalg code points making the server bail. If it's the length of sigalgs announced (my guess, as there seems to be a difference between IPv4 and v6, ie. possible fragmentation differences), I don't know how to tackle this :-(","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2084466257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-30T06:22:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

It's correct that `liboqs` could call out to the `OPENSSL_cleanse` when built against OpenSSL. I'm not an expert on OpenSSL inner workings, but it looks to me as if `OPENSSL_cleanse` is implemented using the same \"trick\" (to avoid being optimized out) that we currently have in place: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/openssl-3.3.0/crypto/mem_clr.c. On the other hand, `memset_s` is (as I understand it) guaranteed to not be optimized out by a standard-compliant compiler: no tricks required. I agree that we should probably call out to `OPENSSL_cleanse` if `memset_s` is not available, but I'm not sure we should prefer `OPENSSL_cleanse` over `memset_s` if the latter is available.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2085549998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-30T14:48:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

By default 48 sig algs are enabled in the current `generate.yml`, which triggers this issue in some servers (at least on my side with the experiments I did). For, example, you can do the following to modify the file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Disable all sig algs\r\nsed -i -e 's/enable: true/enable: false/g' oqs-template/generate.yml\r\n# Enable ML-DSA\r\nsed -i -e '552,660s/enable: false/enable: true/g' oqs-template/generate.yml\r\n# Enable Falcon\r\nsed -i -e '661,763s/enable: false/enable: true/g' oqs-template/generate.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen re-run the python script and compile oqsprovider. If it works for you as well, then I think a possible solution (even though the problem is not from openssl or oqsprovider) as suggested by @baentsch would be to reduce the list of default enabled sig algs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2087051262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-30T20:14:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

weird. Did the `sed` commands work correctly? There should not be any `enable: false` in line 512: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/86605d767a0c7de9462ce4eb70891f8d5e8e248f/oqs-template/generate.yml#L512\r\n\r\nDo you get an error running the Python script if you don't modify the `generate.yml`? If that works, then perhaps don't use `sed` and manually disable some sig algs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2087348616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-30T21:15:28Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry
