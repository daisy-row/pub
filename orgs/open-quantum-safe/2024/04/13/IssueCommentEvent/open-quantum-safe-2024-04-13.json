All the the `oid`s aren't exposed atm so there is no way for me to have a single algorithm id for XMSS nor XMSS^MT.

OQS APIs enumerates each variant of the given algorithm family\r\n2. These enumerations allows selections at build time\r\n3. Stateful Hash Based Signatures LMS, HSS and i think XMSS and XMSS MT can produce an impractical large number of variants.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2053762908","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#issuecomment-2053762908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650","id":2053762908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c56ae9c","user":{"login":"Martyrshot","id":6541356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6541356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot","html_url":"https://github.com/Martyrshot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-13T21:13:58Z","updated_at":"2024-04-13T21:13:58Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> This background/history may be helpful as we consider your request.\r\n> \r\n> 1.
