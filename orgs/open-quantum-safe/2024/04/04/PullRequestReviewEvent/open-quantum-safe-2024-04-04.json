If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nResolves #1539\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

The `test_sha3` test ran fine when I removed all instances of `n_out` so I'm curious if this is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\nIf `n_out` is indeed unnecessary, then perhaps we can also remove the wrapper structs `intrn_shake128_inc_ctx` and `intrn_shake256_inc_ctx` and instead point `state->ctx` directly to an instance of `EVP_MD_CTX`.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nResolves #1539\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

The `test_sha3` test ran fine when I removed all instances of `n_out` so I'm curious if this is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\nIf `n_out` is indeed unnecessary, then perhaps we can also remove the wrapper structs `intrn_shake128_inc_ctx` and `intrn_shake256_inc_ctx` and instead point `state->ctx` directly to an instance of `EVP_MD_CTX`.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API?

If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nResolves #1539\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

The `test_sha3` test ran fine when I removed all instances of `n_out` so I'm curious if this is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\nIf `n_out` is indeed unnecessary, then perhaps we can also remove the wrapper structs `intrn_shake128_inc_ctx` and `intrn_shake256_inc_ctx` and instead point `state->ctx` directly to an instance of `EVP_MD_CTX`.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1599\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and
