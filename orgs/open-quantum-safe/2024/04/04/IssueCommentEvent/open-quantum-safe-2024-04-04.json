My plan was to add a Nettle backend and run CI [there](https://gitlab.com/gnutls/nettle), once their SHAKE interface has settled. Additionally/alternatively I could add a non-exhaustive test here, wrapping the existing callbacks.\r\n\r\nCool! It would be great to see another liboqs integration. I think it would be a good idea to also have some sort of testing in liboqs CI so that we don't have to monitor an external repo. Perhaps we can set up a [Docker image](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers) containing nettle and run some tests using it as a common code provider. Or maybe this would be better suited to [`oqs-demos`](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos)---although it's sort of the reverse order of our current demos (i.e. using another project in `liboqs` as opposed to vice versa). Thoughts on this, @baentsch?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, those options are both (imo) out of scope for this PR, so for now please add the non-exhaustive test you mentioned to get it landed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2035826630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-04T00:00:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

I have no plans to take any further action on this front.\r\n\r\nThat's disappointing, but I can understand that changing LF policies is not the reason you have joined LinuxFoundation.\r\n\r\nIn my eyes, LF very clearly does not commit to openness by the way the legal text is written:\r\n\r\nThis whole discussion would be moot if @hartm would simply be able to point to such LF committment. He does not, so it most likely does not exist, but all statements attributed to LF above are stated to be\r\n\r\n> this is my personal opinion. \r\n\r\nFinally, I can understand your sentiment \r\n\r\n> Part of the value of being in an umbrella organization is that we can rely on the larger umbrella organization to have the expertise and time to review those matters when selecting service providers, freeing up time for the technical community to focus on technical matters. I don't have the time or expertise to do that for every service we use, and I am willing to rely on them to do so until there's an indication of a problem developing.\r\n\r\nbut it touches on the core problem: LF checks things to suit its members, not the wider OSS community. You are member of LF, I am not. Thus, LF helps you but has no interest to protect my interests (or those of anyone else outside of LF). Economically understandable -- why should LF help outsiders? But so the question goes in reverse: Why should outsiders help LF? I think the answer becomes clearer and clearer by the day (tagging @thb-sb fyi).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/comments/2037851882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-04T18:02:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Requiring that *all* email lists in the PQCA be public is not fine (security lists, budget discussion lists, code of conduct reporting lists, etc. need to be private), and attempting to specify all of the things that shouldn't be public is going to be a difficult exercise.
