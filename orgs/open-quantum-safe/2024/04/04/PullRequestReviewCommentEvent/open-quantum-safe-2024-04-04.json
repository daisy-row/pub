The `test_sha3` test ran fine when I removed all instances of `n_out` so I'm curious if this is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\nIf `n_out` is indeed unnecessary, then perhaps we can also remove the wrapper structs `intrn_shake128_inc_ctx` and `intrn_shake256_inc_ctx` and instead point `state->ctx` directly to an instance of `EVP_MD_CTX`.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?
