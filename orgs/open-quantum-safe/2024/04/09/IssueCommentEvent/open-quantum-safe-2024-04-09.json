Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is â‰¥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2044209123","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2044209123","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2044209123,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM552Cfj","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-09T06:03:32Z","updated_at":"2024-04-09T06:03:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@bhess, allow me to comment on and correct a possible misunderstanding behind \r\n\r\n> Your rhetoric with self-respect is personal,\r\n\r\nIt is, but surely was not meant to be insulting to you and I apologize sincerely if it got across that way: I meant to convey the notion that (indeed for me _personally_) a (co)chair's commitment to the project should be significant; _I_ personally do not think _my_ level of commitment would be high enough to warrant taking on any TSC position, for example.\r\n\r\nWhat \"triggered\" me so much was the apparent position-grab of your company even before we decided on who chairs the TSC: An IBMer, who never contributed a single line of code to the project, self-nominated to be an OQS representative: This felt like a \"power grab\" prepared over the course of a year, ever since IBM approached OQS to join LF, to be completed. IBM (sorry, you're a member of it) taking co-chair position then felt like \"second best\" thing your company settled for after the first attempt failed because someone noticed the nominee isn't member of the TSC.\r\n\r\nThe latter triggered me a second time: It was _not_ noted that the nominee never contributed, it was only noted he is no TSC member: This (omission) ran counter to what even LF stated as a guiding principle of FOSS projects, namely merit-based decision taking.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, IBM&LF lost any trustworthiness to me personally as guardians of the FOSS nature of OQS and I was about the quit the project immediately and leave you to this understanding of what OSS seems to be: The rule of the people with money. @dstebila had me reconsider and I wrote my ass off in the past few weeks trying to convey what I think this project should be and highlight the deficiencies in the model the LF seems to hold high.\r\n\r\nNow to the second part:\r\n\r\n> by no means I want to take anything \"away from you\", you are the original author of the test server and nginx in oqs-demos. I deeply respect your dedication and contribution to the project.\r\n\r\nThanks -- but behind this seems to lurk another misunderstanding of my comments that I'd like to clarify: I _want_ stuff to be taken away from me; I want to retire and hand over responsibility for code and users, but I want to do that knowing that there's sufficient (at least time) commitment by the people doing it.\r\n\r\nAm I so wrong wondering whether the entities making money off this code shouldn't be _doing_ at least as much as the people working for free??\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, \r\n\r\n> And nginx would be a component of such a 'testserver' project.\r\n\r\nalready is more of a commitment that I thought it was when you originally stated it, thanks! I don't think it amounts to more than maybe 10% of your time, though, would you agree? Does IBM allow you to state how much of your time you can contribute to OQS? If IBM had an aggregate (set of people) of say more than 1 person year (PY) _actively contributing_ (being at least Contributors, better Committers) at this level, the sum of this may justify an OQS position (co)deciding the future of this project -- but then based on merit, not on money. Side note: UWaterloo alone has people not members of the TSC that do more right now and my feeling is that Cisco and SandboxAQ are also more committed; but to change this \"feeling\" into facts, what about this:\r\n\r\nI will work on creating a merit-based metric for `oqs-provider` and we can discuss in that PR to see whether it may be a model for the wider project, too.\r\n\r\nThis of course only if we can agree this project should be run on technical merit and not corporate might.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2044209123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-09T06:03:34Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Currently these are only found in the sarif file attached to the action.\r\n\r\nThe scan is currently reporting\r\n \r\n - We are using Github actions that are not 'pinned' by version, ie by specifying the hash. This is regarded as unsafe as it prevents reproducibility. [More details](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/376f465c111c39c6a5ad7408e8896cd790cb5219/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies). My proposal is to identify the current versions in use, and pin at these versions. Making this change should be safe. but will require us to periodically review the versions in use and update as needed\r\n \r\n - Similar to the above, in one one (unix.yaml in upstreamcheck, where we do a pip install from the requirements file - It does specify versions, but for the above reason the check suggests hashes to improve supply chain security\r\n \r\n - each github action also needs to specify permissions ([see here](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/376f465c111c39c6a5ad7408e8896cd790cb5219/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) ). I can take a pass at this, there is some risk of making an error (albeit easily backed-off) if any permissions added are too constrained. Hopefully we can mitigate this through careful review\r\n \r\n Would you be ok with this direction @baentsch ? I would be inclined to do the pinning in one PR, and the permissions change in a different one just to separate the concerns. \r\n \r\n In terms of the openssf PR itself, this could be rerun in draft once the above are merged.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2044677446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-09T10:34:34Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is â‰¥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2045519322","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2045519322","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2045519322,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM557CXa","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-09T15:44:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-09T15:44:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"One more thing commenting to @bhess:\r\n\r\n> please let me state my recollection of the TSC formation and the co-chair/vice-chair election: Douglas invited me to join the TSC, among long-running contributors to OQS, independent from my employer's membership in the PQCA.

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR.  \r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add Kyber libjade implementation to library.\r\n- [x] Modify `copy_from_upstream.py` to pull directly from libjade.\r\n- [x] Fix CI issues.\r\n- [x] Add testing.\r\n- [x] Update documentation.\r\n- [ ] Correct CBOM generation errors.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
