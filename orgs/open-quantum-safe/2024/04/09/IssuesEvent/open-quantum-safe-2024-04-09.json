The reference code on x86 (and sometimes aarch64) is (almost) always faster (more handshakes per second) than the performance version for classical ECDHE (x25519/x448) with signature algorithm: Ed25519 or Dilithium2.\r\nWith Ed25519:\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-ref) | 1575.83\r\n- X448 (x86_64-ref) | 1033.33\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-noport) | 1514.52\r\n- X448 (x86_64-noport) | 1054.72 (here the performance code is faster)\r\n\r\nor (aarch64)\r\n\r\n- X25519 (aarch64-ref) | 1261.40\r\n- X448 (aarch64-ref) | 608.65\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n- X25519 (aarch64-noport) | 1252.21\r\n- X448 (aarch64-noport) | 602.88\r\n\r\nWith Dilitihum2:\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-ref) | 1320.63\r\n- X448 (x86_64-ref) | 836.89\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-noport) | 1283.85\r\n- X448 (x86_64-noport) | 814.40\r\n\r\nWhen looking at post-quantum key exchanges it makes sense (performance code is faster than reference) but with classical key exchange it seems to be the opposite on x86.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I select RSA2048 or ECDSAprime256v1 those results for ECDHE make sense (performance code is faster than reference) but then Kyber key exchange has the opposite effect (reference code Kyber + (RSA or ECDSA) is faster than performance code).\r\n\r\nIs this a measurement error due to high variance? Is the \"performance code\" for classical key exchanges even different from the \"reference code\" since I would guess you use the OpenSSL implementation?

The reference code on x86 (and sometimes aarch64) is (almost) always faster (more handshakes per second) than the performance version for classical ECDHE (x25519/x448) with signature algorithm: Ed25519 or Dilithium2.\r\nWith Ed25519:\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-ref) | 1575.83\r\n- X448 (x86_64-ref) | 1033.33\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-noport) | 1514.52\r\n- X448 (x86_64-noport) | 1054.72 (here the performance code is faster)\r\n\r\nor (aarch64)\r\n\r\n- X25519 (aarch64-ref) | 1261.40\r\n- X448 (aarch64-ref) | 608.65\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n- X25519 (aarch64-noport) | 1252.21\r\n- X448 (aarch64-noport) | 602.88\r\n\r\nWith Dilitihum2:\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-ref) | 1320.63\r\n- X448 (x86_64-ref) | 836.89\r\n\r\nvs\r\n\r\n- X25519 (x86_64-noport) | 1283.85\r\n- X448 (x86_64-noport) | 814.40\r\n\r\nWhen looking at post-quantum key exchanges it makes sense (performance code is faster than reference) but with classical key exchange it seems to be the opposite on x86.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I select RSA2048 or ECDSAprime256v1 those results for ECDHE make sense (performance code is faster than reference) but then Kyber key exchange has the opposite effect (reference code Kyber + (RSA or ECDSA) is faster than performance code).\r\n\r\nIs this a measurement error due to high variance? Is the \"performance code\" for classical key exchanges even different from the \"reference code\" since I would guess you use the OpenSSL implementation? Is there any other explanation for these strange results?\r\n\r\nBy the way, thank you for making and maintaining this project!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-09T18:22:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
