I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is â‰¥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower.

With this, I completely lost trust in the openness of LF, the sincerity of the people voting and in the open and mutually respectful cooperation that existed in OQS before.\r\n\r\n>@hartm, fyi: @christianpaquin with the addition of this single word (\"verified\") straightened out what the LF charter terms you quoted here couldn't:\r\n\r\n>Your charter states:\r\n\r\n>>The output of all Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions,\r\nincluding voting results and status should be made open and easily visible to all.\r\n\r\n>If it stated instead\r\n\r\n>>All Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions,\r\nincluding verified voting results and status will be made open and easily visible to all without limitation.\r\n\r\n>I trust you see the differences, @hartm: This way, LF no longer can\r\na) decide which voices/opinions to redact out (by publishing only the \"output\")\r\nb) create voting results it likes (by publishing only the \"results\" it likes as done here)\r\nc) delete discussions in the future (by removing access to archives)\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it is the community doing the recording and making this information open to the public, not the LF.  Additionally, in the OQS project, it will be the OQS TSC chair who handles voting, not the LF.  The LF may help the PQCA TAC chair if the chair wishes (some projects do this, some don't), but the TAC chair can also handle things themselves if they like.\r\n\r\nYou all are also free to pick whatever voting process you like.  I wouldn't suggest ruling out closed votes in your charter, but you can always run closed votes with something like Helios (or any other cryptographically secured online voting platform) if you like; Hyperledger, for instance, typically runs elections with Helios.  That being said, I think you will find it very inefficient if you bind yourselves to run even extremely non-controversial votes in complicated ways.\r\n\r\nAs far as your charter suggestion goes, to my knowledge (and please correct me if I'm wrong and missing something), OQS isn't currently compliant even with the existing charter.  For instance, I can't find meeting minutes or meeting recordings of the weekly technical OQS discussions, which would certainly be required by the text of this charter.  We are going to work on fixing this (including hopefully setting up an automated zoom recording that posts meetings to youtube), but for now, I think there is a lot of work to be done.\r\n\r\nI would worry that your charter change would place too much of a burden on the community.  Typically it's hard to find folks who want to take meeting minutes anyway, and requiring every discussion or decision to have extremely detailed minutes will be a burden on small working groups, for instance.  Remember, it is ultimately you all that will need to do this.  The community will decide what to share and post and output, not the LF.\r\n\r\nThanks again for everyone's time!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2041127108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-06T16:07:38Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2041164709","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2041164709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2041164709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM55qbOl","user":{"login":"hartm","id":16846129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODQ2MTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16846129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm","html_url":"https://github.com/hartm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-06T18:44:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-06T18:44:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Wow -- this is all news -- but great news-- to me: So far, nearly each and every change I proposed to the TSC charter was nixed by LF with either of the statements \"we never do it that way\" or \"we always do it that way\". Had you made the statements above earlier, I'd have way fewer grey hairs than I grew due to LF's statements and actions so far.\r\n\r\nI'm glad we are finally getting things clarified.  Some things are flexible (voting, documentation style, etc.) and some things are unfortunately not due to legal constraints (DCO, licensing, etc.).  \r\n\r\n> In this case, let's bring the charter in line with what's documented in github and keep operating how we always did before LF appeared.\r\n\r\nOur goal has never been to dramatically change how things operate.  We just want to make sure there enough guardrails around the project so that users and contributors are protected legally, the community remains open and welcoming, and everyone can build secure production code.\r\n\r\nYou should also realize you can have governing documents outside the charter.  You can pass a voting policy, for instance, that doesn't need a charter update.  In general, I'd encourage you to document other policies like what you have in the github formally, but outside the charter.  For legal reasons, it's good to keep the charters concise and compact.\r\n\r\n> Let's also change the \"openness\" statement to the proposed\r\n\r\n>> All Project discussions, proposals, timelines, decisions,\r\nincluding verified voting results and status will be made open and easily visible to all without limitation.\r\n\r\n> This would immediately alleviate all my concerns.\r\n\r\nChanging the charter to this might make it difficult from the project to stay in compliance with the charter, as I mentioned in my previous comment, and this can cause issues.  Instead, I'd suggest you think about what this concretely means (recording meetings and making them public, taking meeting minutes, etc.) and document that.  Then you can pass that as a separate policy of the TSC.  This would also make it clear exactly what folks should do and will remove any ambiguity about best practices.  The charter is deliberately left a little bit ambiguous here, as it is up to projects to determine exactly what is meant.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?

This membership --IMO unfortunately-- is not aligned with actual technical activity, let alone the \"Committer\" designation as [documented](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#committers): We have dedicated Maintainers (@dstebila @baentsch @thb-sb), Committers (@bhess @christianpaquin @ashman-p ) as well as non-Contributors (@brian-jarvis-aws ) in the TSC. In turn, and as a significant omission, we do not have another maintainer (@vsoftco) in the TSC.\r\n\r\n> I think it could be extended to Contributors (perhaps with the voting power reduced to 50%).\r\n\r\nThis would make things pretty unwieldy: Why 50%? Should someone that just made a minor text contribution a long time ago have the same voting power as someone delivering a major feature and keeping on contributing? If the TSC should represent the technical community, I'd suggest having only Maintainers to have voting rights in the TSC: According to the [definition](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#community-and-roles) those are people that consistently help the community with contributions as well as reviews and Q&A, i.e., consistently documented technical acumen. From that perspective, we could argue @pi-314159 should be on the TSC as maintainer of `oqs-boringssl`. I'd surely also invite @brian-jarvis-aws to commit being [maintainer](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#maintainers) of `oqs-openssh`and @bhess as a representative of another integration company could commit to be maintainer of `oqs-demos`.

Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is â‰¥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2041211458","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2041211458","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2041211458,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM55qmpC","user":{"login":"hartm","id":16846129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODQ2MTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16846129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm","html_url":"https://github.com/hartm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hartm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-06T21:38:05Z","updated_at":"2024-04-06T21:38:05Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">  I'd suggest having only Maintainers to have voting rights in the TSC\r\n\r\nThis is how the vast majority of projects that I work with start out.  Once there are so many maintainers that meetings become unwieldly, then usually some kind of elections are held (or there is some other more deterministic process to determine who is on the TSC; e.g. parts of the codebase or repos are guaranteed maintainers).  \r\n\r\n> . From that perspective, we could argue @pi-314159 should be on the TSC as maintainer of oqs-boringssl. I'd surely also invite @brian-jarvis-aws to commit being maintainer of oqs-opensshand @bhess as a representative of another integration company could commit to be maintainer of oqs-demos. This way, TSC representation and technical contribution activity would be much better aligned.\r\n\r\nMakes sense to me!\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your time everyone!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2041211458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-06T21:38:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
