Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is ≥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2038977264","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2038977264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2038977264,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM55iFLw","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-05T05:33:01Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T05:33:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"My personal experience in the first TSC meeting was one of \"being rolled over\" (as documented [here](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1731) and [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/7)). This may have to do with my lack of mastery of spoken English or knowledge of \"Roberts Rules\" or the meeting happening late in my day (I'm an \"early bird\").\r\n\r\nOn this experience alone, but also based on my beliefs in \"openness\" I'd suggest to avoid \"decisions on the spot\" or \"attendance-focused decision making\" and do decision-preparation and -taking openly and online such as in this case (thanks @dstebila for bringing this up in this way!).\r\n\r\nTo the concrete topics above, my opinion is that\r\n- Secret Ballots should never happen in an _Open_ Source project\r\n- Decisions in a global OSS project should never only be taken by (a majority of) the people having the money to attend physical meetings or the \"good fortune\" to be wide awake or have a higher mastery of the language while the meeting takes place -- particularly as all of this can be gamed by the meeting set-up.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this may\r\n- slow down decision-making\r\n- require more effort (to consider and respond to other's opinions voiced outside of meetings)\r\n\r\nIn turn, though, decisions and their implications thus should be\r\n- more well thought-through/be of higher quality\r\n- more well documented for posterity (and/or easier to reconsider when key decision facts --that are then openly documented-- change) allowing faster action then\r\n\r\nThis therefore proposes to change the LF-provided charter to\r\n- not permit voting at meetings but require online voting (open for sufficient time)\r\n- ban secret voting to enable personal responsibility-taking for decisions\r\n- use meetings only to exchange opinions, possibly introducing and explaining motions but always document in minutes those motions and opinions openly for non-attendees (or people asleep during the meeting :) to ponder before making their decision\r\n\r\nI firmly believe there is time in an OSS project to come to generally accepted/acceptable decisions: We're not talking about life-or-death decisions that need to be taken in an instant.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2038977264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T05:33:02Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

@baentsch [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/114#issuecomment-2037851882):\r\n\r\n> but it touches on the core problem: LF checks things to suit its members, not the wider OSS community. \r\n\r\nI have to say that I couldn't agree more with this.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've worked with LF, but certainly not the first time I've contributed to an OSS community, and this is how I see OSS communities:\r\n\r\nthey are often made up of people willing to devote some of their free time to projects that can benefit everyone.\r\nSome people are being paid for working on OSS projects, and mindsets between one who's working \"for free\" and one who's working for a living are completely different.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but OQS was kind of a hobby/lab/playground in the first place, for trying out things around a (not so new anymore) subject (PQC).\r\nWhen I've decided to start following OQS contributors by contributing myself to a couple of OQS sub-projects, at that time I had that vibe of \"here is our canvas, feel _free_ to paint whatever you want\".\r\nI was hoping for constructive feedback on my work, however I did it, and thankfully some people eventually came and spent a couple of hours reviewing what I would no longer call \"my work\" at that point.\r\n\r\nToday, I can't say I still have the same feeling, even if my willingness to contribute persists.\r\n\r\nThis _issue_ with the openness of our ML archives is one of the blockers to that feeling I've attempted to describe above. I'm sure folks at LF have no intention of behaving this way, but it gives me the impression that an external third party is taking over our beloved playground, and is trying to control how we contribute, how we communicate, and what might/should/must get archived.\r\n\r\nSaid differently: now we have to think of DCO, signing stuff (not talking about cryptographic signatures here), we have to wonder \"can I use this mailing list? Who controls it? Is it OQS? Are these the people I met at this conference last year? I'm not sure\".\r\n100% my opinion here: it's too many uncertainties and concerns for newcomers.\r\nTo me, being _free to contribute_ means \"hey I have this idea, let's just push something and see how people will react\", and it doesn't mean \"I have this idea, yeah but should I sign something? What is DCO? Who's going to see my work?

This somewhat more real-world usage goal also was the reason for me doing `oqs-provider`, the integrations and the interop server.\r\n\r\n> To me, being free to contribute means \"hey I have this idea, let's just push something and see how people will react\", and it doesn't mean \"I have this idea, yeah but should I sign something? What is DCO? Who's going to see my work? What are the commitments here because I don't have a lot of time, ho and this ML seems to be kinda private…\".\r\n\r\n+1. Also touches upon https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1 -- for which NO feedback was received by any employee of LF or one of the LF companies: This leads me to think we may want to keep OQS indeed as a playground and let LF shape [PQ Code package](https://github.com/pq-code-package) as they please. This at least is the reason why I'm staying away from that as far as I can (apologies to @praveksharma for not helping with https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1745 for this very reason). It would mean we'd need to push back hard against anything LF can't document generating _real_ value for OQS users, though.\r\n\r\n> I'm sure folks at LF have no intention of behaving this way, but it gives me the impression that an external third party is taking over\r\n\r\nExactly my thoughts. LF slaps on their contracts (leading to discussions such as [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12)), procedures and tooling, sometimes [without explanation or documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/pull/6) most likely to protect its corporate sponsors. But the approach taken doesn't exactly generate sympathy -- particularly by people not paid a \"compensation\" (in the true meaning of the word) to cope with this \"legalese\" (stronger word deleted :-) and/or folks not affiliated with LF (which still is a significant majority in the bigger picture :-).\r\n\r\n> my willingness to contribute persists.\r\n\r\nThat's great to hear and a relief & encouragement for me to not drop the ball immediately and give the LF folks (and employees of LF companies) time to prove their willingness and ability to contribute something of technical value and not just \"process\" and [changing pretty completely the notion of openness from how I understood it](https://github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe/discussions/1731). \r\n\r\nAnd apologies from my side for having turned so \"tardy\" during the past few months that it became clear LF takes over the project: It's simply hard to maintain motivation to work for free for multi-billion-$-profit companies... Their main goal is to make more money, e.g., by protecting their IP (rf. DCO) or keeping the OSS community guessing where they focus their investments (rf. \"budget discussion\" remark [here](https://github.com/PQCA/governance/issues/1#issuecomment-1986517929)) while mine (and I think the general OSS community's contributing to OQS) was to do something sensible for everyone (beyond corporate America that LF pretty exclusively seems to cater to).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/issues/comments/2039590998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T11:43:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

As such, almost all of the code in `liboqs` was written with this function signature in mind.\r\n\r\nModifying `keypair` / `encaps` / etc to error-check `randombytes` would require quite a bit of maintenance on our part. We typically pull in this code from upstream sources (e.g., PQClean / pq-crystals) which would (presumably) still be using the NIST-provided `randombytes` API. Hence, we would have to patch the code and re-patch every time we need to pull in an upstream update.\r\n\r\nI suppose that it might not be too difficult to change the `OQS_randombytes` signature to return a status code and just ignore it in `keypair` / `encaps` / etc. while allowing developers to pass an error-checked implementation to `OQS_randombytes_custom_algorithm`. This would also enable us to add better error handling in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2039942225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T14:26:29Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is ≥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2039952204","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2039952204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2039952204,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM55lzNM","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-05T14:31:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T14:31:19Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> it feels a bit early to lock down things\r\n\r\nWell, LF _has_ locked down things in the TSC charta they prescribed to prevail and they, particularly IBM if memory serves, used this to drive the first TSC meeting in the way it was done.\r\n\r\n> until we have a chance to (practically) understand the nature of the decisions to make in the TSC vs. the ones that will continue to happen in the technical OQS meetings\r\n\r\nI'd actually be fine with this: Completely sideline the TSC as an LF entity and continue to discuss all topics that [LF doesn't want to hide (security and budgeting)](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/pull/114#issuecomment-2037907820) in the original meeting format driven by technology and contributions and not by politics.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2039952204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T14:31:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The goal of all of this extra stuff that the LF requires is not to protect member companies as much as end users of the software.\r\n\r\n>Correct me if I'm wrong, but OQS was kind of a hobby/lab/playground in the first place, for trying out things around a (not so new anymore) subject (PQC).\r\n>When I've decided to start following OQS contributors by contributing myself to a couple of OQS sub-projects, at that time I had that vibe of \"here is our canvas, feel free to paint whatever you want\".\r\n\r\nThis is wonderful, and we want to ensure that there is space to \"play\" in OQS/PQCA.  But we also have to acknowledge that if we want to build production-grade software, we can't entirely take an attitude of \"here is our canvas, feel free to paint whatever you want\".\r\n\r\n> I'm sure folks at LF have no intention of behaving this way, but it gives me the impression that an external third party is taking over our beloved playground, and is trying to control how we contribute, how we communicate, and what might/should/must get archived.\r\n\r\nWe always try to make code contributions as frictionless and as easy as possible.  Unfortunately, we have to deal with the reality of the world:  that there are [bad actors](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/03/30/xz-backdoor-cve-2024-3094/) and we need safeguards against them.  It is an unfortunate fact of software development that if you want to use code in any kind of deployment, it needs to be appropriately legally protected, or otherwise any users/deployers could face legal action.\r\n\r\n> Said differently: now we have to think of DCO, signing stuff (not talking about cryptographic signatures here), we have to wonder \"can I use this mailing list? Who controls it? Is it OQS?\r\n\r\nThe mailing list(s) is totally open and public today; Michael's points were focused on ensuring it stayed that way.\r\n\r\n>now we have to think of DCO\r\n\r\nI highlighted the need for DCO above:\r\n> A couple of things: [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) is important because it protects open source code from malicious contributions or contributions where someone is trying to \"sneak\" their IP or licensed code into an open source project. There is actually a [whole wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes) on why the LF has a DCO process; you might find it interesting to read.\r\n\r\nYou may think that it is unfortunate, but it is necessary if you want people to be able to confidently use your code. \r\n\r\n> Exactly my thoughts. LF slaps on their contracts (leading to discussions such as this), procedures and tooling, sometimes without explanation or documentation most likely to protect its corporate sponsors. \r\n\r\nThe goal of all of this stuff is to protect *users* of code, not corporate members (although they may also benefit from being users of the code).  Developers that wish to see their code used also benefit from these things.\r\n\r\n> That's great to hear and a relief & encouragement for me to not drop the ball immediately and give the LF folks (and employees of LF companies) time to prove their willingness and ability to contribute something of technical value and not just \"process\" and changing pretty completely the notion of openness from how I understood it.\r\n\r\nPeople generally trust the LF, and it's typically because of our track record.  We hope that you all will come around in time.\r\n\r\n> Their main goal is to make more money, e.g., by protecting their IP (rf. DCO) or keeping the OSS community guessing where they focus their investments (rf. \"budget discussion\" remark here)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of misconceptions here that I want to be sure are clarified.\r\n\r\n1.  The DCO *does not* protect corporate IP in the way it seems like you are implying.  If you read what it does and the discussion on it above, you will see that it explicitly grants users of the code all of the IP licenses owned by the company.  The DCO explicitly forces companies to give up IP rights on code that is contributed so that users do not have to worry about IP protections from these companies; your remark above seems to indicate the opposite.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the DCO exists to protect *users* of the code *from* companies that may hold IP related to the code.  I hope this is clear.\r\n\r\n2.  It is common practice in governments and nonprofits (at least in the US) to hold private budget discussions.  In the PQCA, we have some money allocated for security audits.  If we publicly release that budget amount and then ask audit companies to give us quotes for security audits, guess how much money they are likely going to request?\r\n\r\nThis kind of thing may seem unusual if you haven't worked in the nonprofit space before, but it is standard practice.\r\n\r\n> while mine (and I think the general OSS community's contributing to OQS) was to do something sensible for everyone (beyond corporate America that LF pretty exclusively seems to cater to).\r\n\r\nIf you want to see your code used in practice by many, then these practices we are recommending are unfortunately necessary.  You shouldn't use code that hasn't been audited and cleared from a security perspective in production, and you also shouldn't use code that isn't cleared from a legal perspective in production.

Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is ≥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2040235856","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2040235856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2040235856,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM55m4dQ","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-05T16:39:47Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T16:39:47Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'm actually ok if administrative votes use close ballots, as long as they can be verified (using e.g. helios).

I can't speak on behalf of my full organization, @baentsch, and I don't yet have all the answers you are seeking, but that shouldn't prevent us from having a dual production-ready / experimental mindset (like we use to have in OQS with two similar build targets). For me, production ready means using the \"best\" implementation we have access to, for a (potentially draft) standardized algorithm (NIST or in some other venue, e.g. Frodo in ISO), using standardized KATs, and tests. People could further reduce our list with build filters. \"Experimental\" would be everything else; I would still fix the bar to only incorporating \"serious\" algorithms (i.e., considered by a standardization effort, backed by a recognized research team, etc.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2040516374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T19:40:10Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
