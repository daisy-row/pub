For consistency and to remove\r\nadditional dependency on OpenSSL, this switches the use of\r\nCRYPTO_THREAD_run_once with that.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Daiki Ueno <dueno@redhat.com>\r\n\r\n* Make common algorithms pluggable\r\n\r\nThis allows applications to replace the implementation of common\r\ncryptographic algorithms at runtime, by setting callback functions for\r\neach operations with OQS_AES_set_callbacks, OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks,\r\nOQS_SHA3_set_callbacks, and OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks.  Those functions\r\nmay be called once before OQS_init; otherwise the default\r\nimplementation will be used.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Daiki Ueno <dueno@redhat.com>\r\n\r\n* Add option to dynamically load libcrypto.so.*\r\n\r\nThis adds OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL build option to use OpenSSL through\r\ndynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to\r\nthe library at build time.\r\n\r\nThat way the applications could use their favorite implementation of\r\ncommon cryptographic primitives without pulling in the OpenSSL as a\r\nhard dependency.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Daiki Ueno <dueno@redhat.com>\r\n\r\n* Add tests for OQS_*_set_callbacks\r\n\r\nThis adds tests that exercise OQS_*_set_callbacks by overriding one of\r\nthe function of each and ensuring the wrapper function is called.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Daiki Ueno <dueno@redhat.com>\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Daiki Ueno <dueno@redhat.com>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commits/32afec8fccd77a264e6104764986ce46d120f5ff"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-05T14:20:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
