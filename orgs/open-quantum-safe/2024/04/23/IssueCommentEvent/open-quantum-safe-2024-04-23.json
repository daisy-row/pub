Specifically in both the unix (macos/linux) and windows builds:\r\n 1. copy_from_upstream - this script uses python to copy some implementations across from pqclean etc. \r\n 2. for macOS/windows only, prior to running tests (see below)\r\n \r\n So the code is used then - but I think the important point is why anything would change ie break it. As I see it this would be\r\n  - where a developer needs additional dependencies in these places (or others). They would need to add the right sha, and may need to recalculate the dependency chain. Docs should cover this\r\n   - where a particular dependency gets removed, perhaps replaced. I think this is unlikely as usually libraries just add new versions (which we'd only use when we choose to)\r\n   - where we decide to review/update our dependencies. either manually, or using a tool like dependabot - but it should just be part of the process, so answered by documentation\r\n   \r\nFor the docs, making sure the developer knows where to look is important - I suggested above adding a pointer within the actual requirements.txt. Could also add a link within the relevant script, or even print output into the build logs if that would be useful?\r\n\r\nThere are lots of steps to move to a trusted production environment - this is just a very small step, and I completely agree those other issues need reviewing too, as does the decision around prod vs research. We can't do it all at once. I hope that this change also gives more confidence to other projects looking at oqs (and other pqca projects) as a source, that we have a good handle on supply chain security (I know there's many other parts, a lot already done, and this checklist is simplistic) - reputation.\r\n\r\nWe then have the pinning of github actions\r\n\r\nWe wouldn't expect versions to be withdrawn, so this is more a maint task when we want to upgrade our build action versions.\r\n\r\nOSSF themselves say:\r\n\r\n_Pinned dependencies reduce several security risks:\r\n\r\nThey ensure that checking and deployment are all done with the same software, reducing deployment risks, simplifying debugging, and enabling reproducibility.\r\n\r\nThey can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the security of the project (in the case where you've evaluated the pinned dependency, you are confident it's not compromised, and a later version is released that is compromised).\r\n\r\nThey are one way to [counter dependency confusion (aka substitution) attacks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/), in which an application uses multiple feeds to acquire software packages (a \"hybrid configuration\"), and attackers fool the user into using a malicious package via a feed that was not expected for that package.\r\n\r\nHowever, pinning dependencies can inhibit software updates, either because of a security vulnerability or because the pinned version is compromised. Mitigate this risk by:\r\n\r\nusing automated tools to notify applications when their dependencies are outdated;\r\nquickly updating applications that do pin dependencies._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last section is relevant -- A follow-on action would ideally be to look at automatic dependency updates/recommendations. For example dependabot manages this well for github actions . It should also manage python. I'll add:\r\n- [ ] open issue on dependency management tools\r\n\r\n \r\n Finally - I note the linux build uses the openquantumsafe/ci-debian-buster-amd64 image - where does this get created?
