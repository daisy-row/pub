So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

Only now I saw the warning in the README file\r\n> \r\n> > A limitation present in older OpenSSL versions is the number of default groups supported: [openssl/openssl#23624](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/23624) , e.g., passing to [SSL_CTX_set1_groups](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/SSL_CTX_set1_groups.html). Therefore caution is advised activating all KEMs supported by oqsprovider: This may lead to openssl crashing, depending on the OpenSSL version used: The problem is gone in OpenSSL \"master\" branch and (will be gone) in the releases 3.3.0, 3.2.2., 3.1.6 and 3.0.14.\r\n> \r\n> So perhaps what I observe is just [openssl/openssl#23624](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/23624) ? I'm using a version where this was not fixed. I will be happy to report back when Arch updates to the new OpenSSL version.\r\n> \r\n> I don't know if it's exactly what @mouse07410 originally reported because he didn't mention changing the `generate.yml` file to enable more algs.\r\n\r\nI get the same issue with\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ openssl -version\r\nOpenSSL 3.3.0 9 Apr 2024 (Library: OpenSSL 3.3.0 9 Apr 2024).\r\n```\r\n\r\n`fwupd.org` fails immediately, while `index.crates.io` hangs for a while before failing, so I think there are two different issues.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho Q | openssl s_client -provider default -provider oqsprovider -connect fwupd.org:443                                                                                              130 ↵ iyan@bespin\r\nConnecting to 54.68.82.113\r\nCONNECTED(00000003)\r\n4037677FA67A0000:error:0A000126:SSL routines::unexpected eof while reading:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:687:\r\n---\r\nno peer certificate available\r\n---\r\nNo client certificate CA names sent\r\n---\r\nSSL handshake has read 0 bytes and written 454 bytes\r\nVerification: OK\r\n---\r\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\r\nThis TLS version forbids renegotiation.\r\nCompression: NONE\r\nExpansion: NONE\r\nNo ALPN negotiated\r\nEarly data was not sent\r\nVerify return code: 0 (ok)\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho Q | openssl s_client -provider default -provider oqsprovider -connect index.crates.io:443                                                                                        130 ↵ iyan@bespin\r\nConnecting to 18.165.183.79\r\nCONNECTED(00000003)\r\nclosed\r\n---\r\nno peer certificate available\r\n---\r\nNo client certificate CA names sent\r\n---\r\nSSL handshake has read 7 bytes and written 453 bytes\r\nVerification: OK\r\n---\r\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\r\nThis TLS version forbids renegotiation.\r\nCompression: NONE\r\nExpansion: NONE\r\nNo ALPN negotiated\r\nEarly data was not sent\r\nVerify return code: 0 (ok)\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nTomorrow I will do another `git bisect` fixing the `oqsprovider` version and changing OpenSSL instead.

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry
