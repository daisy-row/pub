Or are these things that have been discussed and agreed within LinuxFoundation-registration-only fora (that I do not subscribe to until [LF agrees to retain them open for everyone](https://github.com/PQCA/governance/issues/1#issuecomment-1996593244))?

I also don't understand why `core` is listed as maintainer for some projects: This doesn't make any sense to me (\"if everybody is responsible, no-one is\"). @claucece as listed with write permissions for `boringssl` also is somewhat surprising to me.

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The code in the DCO bot [is here ](https://github.com/dcoapp/app/blob/de32b139d0f6c84670a764827a8878621913df53/lib/dco.js#L20) and perhaps author is null? If so there isn't a problem, plus we still have the DCO for additional contributions we make within oqs?\r\n\r\nI agree with the principle that since this is a fork, it's infeasible to expect signoffs if that project doesn't use the same mechanism, and doesn't make sense to manipulate commits from upstream. \r\n\r\nThere is also the option of allowing remediation commits (integrator adds an additional commit in the PR) - but how viable this is may depend on the workflow when merging.

Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is ≥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2048453995","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2048453995","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2048453995,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM56GO1r","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-10T21:19:58Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T21:19:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> One more thing commenting to @bhess:\r\n> \r\n> > please let me state my recollection of the TSC formation and the co-chair/vice-chair election: Douglas invited me to join the TSC, among long-running contributors to OQS, independent from my employer's membership in the PQCA. During the first TSC meeting, three candidates were nominated for the TSC co-chair/vice-chair role by other members of the TSC. Nobody did nominate themself.\r\n> \r\n> @dstebila confirmed that @ashman-p nominated your IBM colleague to represent OQS at the TAC; my understanding of the course of events at that moment of the meeting thus indeed were wrong as I understood that as a self-nomination. I duly apologize.\r\n> \r\n\r\nOther duties and travel kept me busy over the last couple of weeks.  So, at the risk of waking up a sleeping giant ... I see from the above that I unknowingly contributed to some of @baentsch's unease with how things went in that 1st meeting. For that I am truly sorry. I will add that there was/is no intent of any kind of take-over corporate or otherwise on my part. Perhaps being somewhat naive to this world with some amount of ignorance, ...  here are the factors that played into my nomination of someone other than Douglas. \r\n1. it would take some of the administrative load off Douglas. \r\n2. I also really imagined that whomever chaired any of these groups would be more a facilitator and less of a driver. Which means giving room and weight to all of the participants.\r\n\r\nHowever, I also do see now how this situation could be perceived, so, again my sincere apologies. \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2048453995/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-10T21:19:59Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
