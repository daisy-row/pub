Additionally, the TSC operates according to Robert's Rules of Order, which provides several mechanisms for voting.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, we will have two types of things to vote on: general matters, and matters involving people (elections, additions/removals from TSC).  I make this distinction as Robert's Rules provides the option for elections to be done using either public or secret ballot.\r\n\r\nFor voting on general matters, my proposal would be:\r\n- Motions can be proposed either at a meeting or electronically on Github by opening a clearly labeled issue/pull request in the TSC repository.  \r\n- Motions can be voted on either at a meeting or electronically on Github. The Charter lays out the quorum/passing requirements for such votes (at a meeting: quorum is ≥50% of TSC voting members, passed by a majority vote of those in attendance; electronically: passed by a majority vote of TSC voting members). We can use built-in Github mechanisms for voting (thumbs up/thumbs down), or there are dedicated Github-based voting mechanisms like [gitvote](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote).\r\n\r\nFor voting on matters involving people (e.g., elections), the TSC should decide whether we want those types of votes to be done using public or secret ballot.  If public ballot, then we could just use the same procedure as for normal matters.  If secret ballot, then we should identify an online voting mechanism we want to use, such as [Helios voting](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/) which the IACR uses for its electronic elections.\r\n\r\nAs we will have the option of voting on things both in meetings and electronically, we'll have to figure out which we actually prefer to do.  I think this will depend on how our TSC meeting culture develops -- do most people show up, do we have enough time in advance to think and enough time in meetings to discuss and make a well-informed vote during the meeting, or do we want the extra time that comes from being able to reflect and vote afterwards, albeit at the cost of potentially moving slower. I think I'd wait a few months to see how our meetings develop.\r\n\r\n@open-quantum-safe/tsc and others, please feel free to discuss here in advance of our next meeting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2048959167","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12#issuecomment-2048959167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/12","id":2048959167,"node_id":"IC_kwDOLITcCM56IKK_","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-11T05:37:14Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T05:37:14Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> at the risk of waking up a sleeping giant \r\n\r\nThere's no need to be worried of this, to the contrary, I've been put off (and indeed pretty much _to_ sleep) by the politics and formalism's introduced with the arrival of LF.\r\n\r\nI would accept a nomination for \"elephant\" (in porcelain shop), though :-)\r\n\r\nThat said, please decide whether you want to wake me up or not.
