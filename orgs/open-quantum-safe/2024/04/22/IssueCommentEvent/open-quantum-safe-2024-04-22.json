Mitigation: document process\r\n - If the python version supplied by github were to upgrade python we could find a transitive dependency changes, leading to a build break until above was done. Mitigation: use the github-python plugin to use a relatively fixed version of python (much much smaller change with minor fixes) << as in earlier comment\r\n \r\n Both of the above seem reasonable to me given the intent of the scorecard recommended approach is to avoid unknown changes to what is being produced - for example not just a new, but a modified/hacked/illicit version of a library.\r\n \r\n * We have two things\r\n  - a) The scorecard check - this is passive - it is only giving us a score, so will not progress, though we should monitor & plan action if we regress\r\n  - b) the change to the pip install - this is within the PR - but see previous bullet point\r\n  \r\n* How people can fix? - documentation  \r\n\r\nPROCEDURES.md - I can add changes there, but would suggest within this PR it focusses on scorecard, and we raise additional issue/issues to handle DCO and SBOM (which I can also help with). Agree with the point about making sure the change is understandable from the contents of the repo/docs (I could also add a pointer/info in the requirements file itself for extra clarity)\r\n\r\nRolling out to repo - makes sense we allow a little time (a few weeks?) after the change is merged into liboqs (suggest a checkpoint at the TSC?) before working on the other repos -- and of course they should each go through their own pr approval). As to which repos, ultimately any that has any supported code within.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2069203321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-04-22T11:54:17Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
