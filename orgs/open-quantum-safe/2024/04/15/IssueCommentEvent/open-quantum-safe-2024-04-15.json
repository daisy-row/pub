Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2057893845","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#issuecomment-2057893845","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650","id":2057893845,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c56qPfV","user":{"login":"Martyrshot","id":6541356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6541356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot","html_url":"https://github.com/Martyrshot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-15T22:07:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-15T22:07:29Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> @ashman-p:  However, a raw key may be hard to distinguish between the single and multi-tree variants of both protocols without an added API flag.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar enough with LMS to know for sure, but would you say this is would be similar to XMSS and XMSS^MT? In my opinion it would make sense for those two variations to be separate algorithm identifiers. So if the partition for LMS is similar, I think it makes sense to have separate algorithms for single and mutli-tree LMS.
