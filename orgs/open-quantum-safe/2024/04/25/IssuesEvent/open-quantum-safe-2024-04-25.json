Provide cross-platform code to load shared libraries (alternative to dlopen / dlclose)\r\n2. #ifdef around `#include <dlfcn.h>` / dlfcn functions (simply ignore on windows and assume that required libraries are loaded).\r\n3. Require dlfcn-win32 package with basic instructions on the liboqs github page on how to install (prerequisite).\r\n4.
