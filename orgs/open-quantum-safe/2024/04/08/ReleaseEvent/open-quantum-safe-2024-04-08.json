More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**oqs-provider** is a standalone [OpenSSL 3](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)-based quantum-safe and [hybrid key exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology) for TLS 1.3, as well as quantum-safe and hybrid X.509 certificate generation, CMS, CMP and `dgst` (signature) operations.\r\n\r\nWhen deployed, the `oqs-provider` binary (shared library) thus adds support for quantum-safe cryptographic operations to any standard OpenSSL(v3) installation. The ultimate goal is that all `openssl` functionality shall be [PQC-enabled](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).\r\n\r\nIn general, the oqs-provider `main` branch is meant to be usable in conjunction with the `main` branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and the `master` branch of [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).\r\n\r\nFurther details on building, testing and use can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.6.0-rc1 of oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n### Security considerations\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### What's New\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.5.3 release of oqs-provider and is fully tested to be used in conjunction with the main branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs). This release is guaranteed to be in sync with v0.10.0 of `liboqs`.\r\n\r\nThis release also makes available ready-to-run binaries for Windows (.dll) and MacOS (.dylib) compiled for `x64` CPUs. Activation and use is documented in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/USAGE.md).\r\n\r\n### Additional new feature highlights\r\n\r\n* First availability of standardized PQ algorithms, e.g., [ML-KEM](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf), [ML-DSA](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.204.ipd.pdf)\r\n* Support for [Composite PQ operations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs/)\r\n* Alignment with PQ algorithm implementations as provided by [liboqs 0.10.0](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.10.0), most notably updating HQC and Falcon.\r\n* Implementation of security code review recommendations\r\n* Support for more hybrid operations as fully documented [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/ALGORITHMS.md).\r\n* Support for extraction of classical and hybrid key material\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Clarify liboqs_DIR naming convention by @ajbozarth in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/292\r\n* check empty params lists passed by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/296\r\n* Fix minor typos in documentation by @johnma14 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/304\r\n* HQC code point update by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/306\r\n* Fix broken circleci job for macOS by @johnma14 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/305\r\n* Contribution policy by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/286\r\n* Fix link in GOVERNANCE.md [skip ci] by @pi-314159 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/309\r\n* Add a example of how to load oqsprovider using `OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin`. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/308\r\n* Get Windows CI to work again by @qnfm in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/310\r\n* Use `build` directory instead of `_build`. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/314\r\n* correct upstream and Windows CI snafus by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/322\r\n* Revert \"Use `build` directory instead of `_build`.
