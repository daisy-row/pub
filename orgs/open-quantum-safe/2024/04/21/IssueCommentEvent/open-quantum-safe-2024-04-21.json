Looking at the current changes I have doubts about this (i.e., that this has the potential to require manual interventions) but would like to hear your thoughts on this, @planetf1 \r\n- how to ascertain that any warnings this tool may generate will not be considered blockers for use or progress, i.e.,\r\n- how people can themselves fix any errors this tooling may highlight (aka documentation; see below)\r\n\r\n> \r\n>     * Add information about scorecard & tools to aid in pinning dependencies to documentation (discuss where)\r\n\r\nSuch documentation seems prudent to have in this PR already (also see my single questions) to avoid a situation in which things fail for users and they don't know where to look for documentation to \"dig themselves\" out of the proverbial hole this may have plunged them into. My suggestion would be to place this in a file \"PROCEDURES.md\" in the \"docs\" directory.
