So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry
