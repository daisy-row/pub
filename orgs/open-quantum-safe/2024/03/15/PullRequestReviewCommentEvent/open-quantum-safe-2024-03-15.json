#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:

#372: expose `hybrid_classical_` and `hybrid_pq_` `OSSL_PARAMS` for `EVP_PKEY`.\n\nThis commit is an attempt to fix #372, by adding four new [`OSSL_PARAM`] to\n[`EVP_PKEY`].\n\nThe following [`OSSL_PARAM`] are added by this commit:\n  - `hybrid_classical_pub`: an octet string to the classical public key.\n  - `hybrid_classical_priv`: an octet string to the classical private key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_pub`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant public key.\n  - `hybrid_pq_priv`: an octet string to the quantum-resistant private key.\n\nUsing [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`], OpenSSL users should be able to extract the\nspecific subkey they want from an hybrid key.\n\nA test called `test_evp_pkey_params` has been added to ensure that it works\nwith all hybrid algorithms, to also ensure that the output of these parameters\nare consistent between each other.\n\n[`OSSL_PARAM`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html\n[`EVP_PKEY`]:
