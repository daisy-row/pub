After running it however, there is no Server Temp Key listed even though running the same command checking for a standard non-pqc algorithm works fine. The command otherwise completes successfully and you are able to GET / the webpage.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nAfter running `docker run -v `pwd`:/ca -it openquantumsafe/curl:latest openssl s_client --connect test.openquantumsafe.org:6109 -CAfile /ca/CA.crt -groups kyber768 -security_debug_verbose -msg -trace -tls1_3`\r\nTesting with 0.9.2 image results in the same error\r\n\r\nYou will see:\r\n`Security callback: Supported Curve=UNDEF, security bits=192: yes`\r\n`extension_type=supported_groups(10), length=4`\r\n  UNKNOWN (572)` \r\n`extension_type=key_share(51), length=1092`\r\n`NamedGroup: UNKNOWN (572)` with 572 or 0x23C as the default id for kyber768`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhat I expect to be there is equivalent output to running the command with a X25519 curve\r\n`Security callback: Supported Curve=X25519, security bits=128: yes`\r\n`Server Temp Key: X25519, 253 bits`\r\n`NamedGroup: ecdh_x25519 (29)`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n - OS: openquantumsafe/curl:latest\r\n - OpenSSL version: OpenSSL 3.3.0-dev3\r\n - oqsprovider version:   0.5.4-dev\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-15T06:39:03Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
