The build script requires that liboqs is cloned and built.\r\n\r\nThe required changes include the <stdint.h> include and the CMakeLists mods.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Particularly, openssl output in the same versioned structure.

(I should probably have solicited feedback on that choice, earlier, mea culpa. :grimacing:) It should be an easy and quick fix to patch it (in `liboqs`) to `Falcon-*-padded` or `Falcon-*-PADDED` or what-have-you, in alg-param-variant order. However, switching to alg-variant-param will change the PQClean algorithm namespace from `PQCLEAN_FALCON512PADDED_*` to `PQCLEAN_FALCONPADDED512_*`. That's too big a change to fix easily with a patch, so it would require a PR upstream (one with a very large, albeit inconsequential diff) to change the name.\r\n\r\nI'm OK with doing the work, but since we're aiming to cut a release candidate tomorrow, I thought I should check to see if it's worth potentially delaying that for naming conventions.","created_at":"2024-03-04T15:11:09Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T15:11:10Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1710#discussion_r1511324232","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1710","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1511324232"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1710#discussion_r1511324232"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1710"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1511324232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":61,"original_line":61,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1508513666,"original_position":5,"position":5,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1710","id":1748512974,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5oODDO","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1710","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1710.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1710.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1710","number":1710,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Support Falcon PADDED format","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nSupport the fixed-size PADDED format for Falcon signatures and update the existing Falcon code (which intends to implements the COMPRESSED format) to bring it in line with the spec. Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and
