Under that interpretation, having the \"ipd\" algorithms in there makes sense. But not everyone may have that interpretation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, initially \"STD\" meant \"standards-track\" -- but time has moved on and NIST made standardization decisions, so IMO \"STD\" now means exactly what is documented: [\"STD\" selecting all algorithms standardized by NIST](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#oqs_algs_enabled). `liboqs` never meant to \"select winners\" but once they have been selected it should give them particular care and attention. Also, PQC is slowly becoming more \"mainstream\" -- and that means that users should not be concerned with \"standardization details\" but begin to rely on a library to (be able to exactly) deliver what is standardized.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1975802456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-04T06:12:17Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

I think it's good to have this discussion about what \"STD\" means and what the requirements on naming and algorithms are. If I understand your comment @baentsch you mainly consider \"STD\" algorithms with \"names that won't change\". My interpretation was more on the lines of \"algorithm compatibility won't break\".\r\n\r\n> The link quoted above is from 2022. Time has moved on and [FIPS-203](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.203.ipd.pdf) has been published, clearly designating the term \"ML-KEM\" as a standard:\r\n\r\nAlthough the ML-KEM name seems fixed for the final standard, it's still FIPS 203 (_draft_) and afaik the information on the 2022 page still holds: [..\"After the close of the comment period, NIST will revise the draft standards as appropriate based on the feedback received.\"].\r\n\r\n> But then again, this whole discussion aims to make life _easier_ for consumers of the library (not having to adapt their integrations, configs and code to algorithm name changes). This of course only is a concern in case we want to make OQS more \"production oriented\", which _I_ want to move towards. Accordingly I think retaining the \"ipd\" moniker is wrong, misleading and means lots of additional work (here and in all downstreams, now and in the future).\r\n\r\nI'm with you with the goal to make life easier for consumers of the library. The alias feature was meant to allow the use case you promote to always track the latest algorithm version without name changes (for consumers accepting that future versions of the algorithm might be not compatible).\r\nBut again, there are other \"production\" use cases where versioning _is_ important: assume a consumer decides to deploy certificates with the current ML-DSA(-ipd) algorithms. They likely have to continue supporting the certificates for a while before updating to the final standard. Having an explicit \"ipd\" option that guarantees compatibility won't break in the future will make their life easier. Even after standardization versioning can be useful: TLS is a commonly known protocol name, but one might have to support both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 for interoperability with different clients, which is only possible if one can state the protocol version.\r\n\r\n> I'd concede that it might be prudent to introduce a new algorithm class (\"below\" STD) as for example \"STD-track\" to list the algs that probably are subject to re-naming. If you want to do this in this PR, fine with me.\r\n\r\nAgreed that the two classes make sense. Not sure if there is a consensus yet about what algorithms go to \"STD\" and \"STD-track\". Also, with this PR algorithm names and their alias are always both available and can be used interchangeably (e.g., either \"ipd\" can be used for forward-compatibility or \"non-ipd\" for stable names).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1976510828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-04T12:48:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

They likely have to continue supporting the certificates for a while before updating to the final standard. Having an explicit \"ipd\" option that guarantees compatibility won't break in the future will make their life easier.\r\n\r\nHmm... Two questions to check out this argument:\r\n1) Which specification(s) encode algorithm names in certificates?\r\n2) Which software uses `liboqs` directly to generate certificates (and encode its algorithm names into them)?\r\n\r\nMy understanding so far was that OIDs represent algorithms (_and_ their versions) in certificates, but maybe I'm wrong. If so, we can also relax the requirement for proper OID management as per https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/351 and move it to \"management by names\". I'd consider this dead wrong, but welcome comments.\r\n\r\n> Agreed that the two classes make sense. Not sure if there is a consensus yet about what algorithms go to \"STD\" and \"STD-track\". \r\n\r\nProposal:\r\nSTD: ML-KEM, ML-DSA\r\nSTD-track: Sphincs, Falcon, *-ipd\r\n\r\n> Also, with this PR algorithm names and their alias are always both available and can be used interchangeably\r\n\r\nThis exactly is what I don't agree with as sensible: The two cannot and shall not be used interchangeably: -ipd IMO is a non-persistent name; it's the first (and hopefully only) name in `liboqs` encoding algorithm version; \"ML-KEM\", \"ML-DSA\" are persistent names designating the standard algorithms (whichever their code versions).\r\n\r\nUndisputed is that this PR fixes bugs, though, so I'm approving just because of this, not because I agree with your intentions -- which I infer from \r\n\r\n> \"ipd\" can be used for forward-compatibility\r\n\r\nYou want to establish these names and along with that, the need to maintain this code for _a long_ time -- really through space and time: The former denotes the availability of \"-ipd\" in all OQS downstreams, the latter means OQS will never be able to drop it -- and even have to support this code base in addition to the standardized one if and when someone eventually decides to afford some \"production qualities\" to `liboqs`. This increases maintenance and development effort to OQS -- at a time we're _pruning_ stuff as no-one steps forward to do more maintenance-type work (e.g., integrations, profiling, binary/distro management, automated build management, fuzzing, etcetc)...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1976667084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-04T14:10:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
