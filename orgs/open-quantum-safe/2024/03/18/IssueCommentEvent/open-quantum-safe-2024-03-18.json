@feventura it looks like `asan` is unhappy about the code now (2 tests crashing): Could you please take a look?\r\n> \r\n> Regarding these ASan tests, I've noticed something quite unusual while working on #374, which makes me think that it's unrelated to @feventura changes: I also had totally random failure on this job. Since everything is compiled and linked against ASan, and since we have `--output-on-failure`, in case of a memory leak or a memory corruption, we should see an ASan report.\r\n> \r\n> But in that case (and same for my PR), we don't have any ASan report being displayed before the segfault. This is why I've added `--repeat until-pass:5` here: https://github.com/thb-sb/oqs-provider/blob/3b69bbe728819ad9b325580b79d9c9a672ae366e/.github/workflows/linux.yml#L149-L152\r\n> \r\n> I think GitHub has changed their runner configuration recently, and something has been broken here. I've run these tests a million times locally using [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) (to ensure that they were running under the very same environment as GitHub action's). I couldn't managed to reproduce a single crash.\r\n> \r\n> My guess is that since ASan is virtually allocating the whole address space to catch any memory corruption ops, someone may see this as a process requiring too much memory, although this is purely virtual.\r\n\r\nYes I found weird that ASan reported as SegFault but I have not extra information about it. I also tested locally several times locally using [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) and it didn`t crashed once.\r\n\r\nWhat I noticed is that the GitHub actions in this PR failed due to oqs_signatures and oqs_endecode. On my fork it passed successfully when I pushed Saturday, so I repeated on my fork today and it failed due to oqs_tlssig and oqs_endecode, which also point to the totally random failure on this job.\r\n\r\nRegardless I will run [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) locally several times to see today if I can reproduce it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2004362057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-18T16:19:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
