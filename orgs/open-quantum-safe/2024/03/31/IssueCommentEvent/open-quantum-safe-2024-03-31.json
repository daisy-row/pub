I've fix most of the issues, and also greatly simplified the auto install, which now installs liboqs in user's home directory. In addition, the wrapper installs the corresponding ver of liboqs, e.g. liboqs-python 0.10.0 installs liboqs-0.10.0. I believe now it's ready to be merged into 0.10.0. I'll test it a bit more then do the merge. Again, thanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/issues/comments/2028512098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-31T00:40:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
