Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

It seems you essentially added an entry to \"generate.yml\" and correctly built and formatted the code -- so from that perspective the PR is OK.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/ossf/scorecard it's possible some additional permissions may be needed (depending on branch rotection setup).

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature.

It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and
