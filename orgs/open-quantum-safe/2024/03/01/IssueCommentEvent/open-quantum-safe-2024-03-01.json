Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

Reenable Falcon-1024 in weekly extended KAT tests, as it should now pass.\r\n\r\nA couple of points to make review simpler:\r\n- The only differences between the COMPRESSED and PADDED code should be contained in `api.h` and `pqclean.c`. It's probably worth looking at a side-by-side diff of these: for example, `pqclean_falcon-512-padded_clean/pqclean.c` vs `pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c`.\r\n- There are no NIST KATs available for the PADDED variant, so I generated my own from the Falcon reference implementation: see https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-padded-KATs.\r\n- The corresponding upstream PR is PQClean/PQClean#530.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1561 and #1608.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?

But it should be documented that an API call which (is supposed to) set a config can be influenced (may one even say \"crippled\"?) by a global config variable. IMO the behaviour should be fixed to not allow this: An explicit API call should always overrule a global \"default setting\" variable.
