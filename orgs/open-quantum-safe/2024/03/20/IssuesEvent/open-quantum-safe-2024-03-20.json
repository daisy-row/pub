Ask contributors to use \"[skip ci]\" as often as possible, do (CI) spot checks before doing \"heavy lifting\", possibly move more CI to the weekly tests, reduce the repetition of the profiling runs, etc?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/376#issuecomment-2006940977_\r\n\r\nI agree with the above and think some guidelines would help to avoid redundant CI runs, without hurting the overall test quality. This is not necessarily motivated by a lack of available resources (the LF indicated that more Github Actions resources can be made available to the projects, which I think is a good thing), but rather by the desire to make most efficient use of the available resources.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/5/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/5/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-20T09:03:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
