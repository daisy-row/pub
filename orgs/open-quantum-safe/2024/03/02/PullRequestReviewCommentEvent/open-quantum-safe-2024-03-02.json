This fork ensures that we can build static oqs-provider libraries for all platforms.\r\n\r\nSpecific changes:\r\n* Ignore 'build' and 'tmp' folders from git\r\n* Modify CMakeLists.txt per https://stackoverflow.com/a/73886192/1318024 (Android Toolchain problems)\r\n* Permit explicit setting for liboqs header via optional CMake var LIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR\r\n* #include <stdint.h> to ensure that uint64_t and friends are defined.\r\n* Generic wrapper build script for creating builds for all the macOS / iOS / Android platforms we use. The build script requires that liboqs is cloned and built.\r\n\r\nThe required changes include the <stdint.h> include and the CMakeLists mods.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

This fork ensures that we can build static oqs-provider libraries for all platforms.\r\n\r\nSpecific changes:\r\n* Ignore 'build' and 'tmp' folders from git\r\n* Modify CMakeLists.txt per https://stackoverflow.com/a/73886192/1318024 (Android Toolchain problems)\r\n* Permit explicit setting for liboqs header via optional CMake var LIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR\r\n* #include <stdint.h> to ensure that uint64_t and friends are defined.\r\n* Generic wrapper build script for creating builds for all the macOS / iOS / Android platforms we use. The build script requires that liboqs is cloned and built.\r\n\r\nThe required changes include the <stdint.h> include and the CMakeLists mods.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nThere are no known issues hit by this PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing
