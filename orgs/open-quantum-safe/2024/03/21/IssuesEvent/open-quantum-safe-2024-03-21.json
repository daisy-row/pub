Or are these things that have been discussed and agreed within LinuxFoundation-registration-only fora (that I do not subscribe to until [LF agrees to retain them open for everyone](https://github.com/PQCA/governance/issues/1#issuecomment-1996593244))? If so, at least some notice about those LF decisions , e.g. within the issue meant to host the open discussion about this, would have been courteous by the LinuxFoundation team, so everyone knows what they're up to.\r\n\r\nMore strange things: I thought @thomwiggers doesn't have the bandwidth any more for Rust while @Martyrshot agreed to look into this. I also don't understand why `core` is listed as maintainer for some projects: This doesn't make any sense to me (\"if everybody is responsible, no-one is\"). @claucece as listed with write permissions for `boringssl` also is somewhat surprising to me. In turn, I am (admittedly more and more disillusioned by the LF actions) maintainer of `oqs-provider` -- which is _not_ documented.
