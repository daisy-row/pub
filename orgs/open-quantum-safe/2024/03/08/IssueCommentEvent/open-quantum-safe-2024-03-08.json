The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
