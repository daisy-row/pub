Build liboqs on Windows as per regular instructions included for liboqs.  I like using cmake-gui to make the windows solution files.   You can get cmake (that comes with cmake-gui) here:  https://cmake.org/download/\r\n  -a) Set cmake source code to the location where you cloned the main liboqs repository\r\n  -b) Set where to build binary files wherever you want the output.   This location is important for building with liboqs-java.\r\n  -c) Make sure you add an entry called BUILD_SHARED_LIBS as a BOOL and checkmark it (this will ensure the liboqs.dll is built)\r\n  -d) Generate the solution files, and build with VC 2019.  The main liboqs.sln will be in the folder you specify in 1b above.\r\n  -e) Open the liboqs.sln file in visual studio and compile the project.   liboqs.dll will be in the output folder from 1b in a folder called bin (and probably under a Debug or Release folder).   \r\n\r\n2.  To build Liboqs-java on Windows:\r\n -a) Open an \"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019\" (or whatever version of VS code you have).  You can find it in the start menu folder for Visual Studio 2019.  \r\n -b) In the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt cd to the directory where liboqs-java was cloned\r\n -c) Issue the command \"mvn package -P windows \"-Dliboqs.include.dir=[path to liboqs include dir]\" \"-Dliboqs.lib.dir=[path to liboqs lib dir]\r\n      where\r\n          [path to liboqs include dir] is in the path from 1b inside the include folder.  \r\n          [path to liboqs lib dir] is in the path from 1b inside the lib folder.\r\n  -d) If all is well, the oqs-jni.dll and liboqs-java.jar should be in the liboqs-java projects target folder.  \r\n\r\nHere a tested POM file (Test by two people at Entrust with Visual Studio 2019).\r\n\r\n[pom.zip](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java/files/14730334/pom.zip)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java/issues/comments/2016362245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-23T05:37:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
