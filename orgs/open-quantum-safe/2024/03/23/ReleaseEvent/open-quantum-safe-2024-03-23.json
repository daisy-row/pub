More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.10.0 of liboqs. It was released on March 20, 2024.\r\nThis release adds support for ML-KEM (previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber) and ML-DSA (previously known as CRYSTALS-Dilithium), based on the initial public drafts of [FIPS 203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd) and [FIPS 204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd), respectively. OQS continues to support the NIST Round 3 versions of Kyber and Dilithium for interoperability purposes. This release additionally updates HQC to the NIST Round 4 version and adds support for fixed-length Falcon signatures.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.9.2 release of liboqs.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- BIKE: Updated portable C implementation to include constant-time fixes from upstream.\r\n- HQC: Updated to NIST Round 4 version.\r\n- ML-KEM: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of Initial Public Draft (IPD) versions of ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024.\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Falcon: Updated portable C, AVX2, and AArch64 implementations to support fixed-length (PADDED-format) signatures. Fixed the maximum length of variable-length signatures to comply with the NIST Round 3 specification.\r\n- ML-DSA: Added portable C and AVX2 implementations of Initial Public Draft (IPD) versions of ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Improved thread safety.\r\n- Added uninstall support via `ninja uninstall`\r\n- Documented platforms by support tier in PLATFORMS.md.\r\n- Added support for Zephyr RTOS.\r\n- Improved support for macOS on Apple Silicon.\r\n- Removed support for the \"NIST-KAT\" DRBG.\r\n- Added extended KAT test programs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* PR template update & OpenSSL clarification by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1582\r\n* Use
