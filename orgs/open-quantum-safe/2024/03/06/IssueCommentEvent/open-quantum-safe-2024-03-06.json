@dimk1 for only noticing this question now. The option `-provider xyz` does not do filtering, but just enables a specific provider _not yet enabled by global configuration_. In your case, it's highly likely that your `openssl` setup loads a global config file ([\"openssl.cnf\"](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Command_Line_Utilities)) that already activates `oqsprovider` (and `default` provider). If you switch this off, you will _only_ see algs supported by the providers you explicitly request on the command line.
