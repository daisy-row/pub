Add each individual check each places or\r\n2. Refactor the low-level functions to use temporary buffer provided by high-level functions. \r\n\r\nApproach 1 is the easiest, but create too much overhead, and heap is slow. \r\nApproach 2 require rewrite a bit function logic to allocate memory as buffer from high-level function to low-level function.\r\n\r\nI select approach 2. \r\n\r\n## Should out of memory at crypto implementation exit the program? \r\n\r\nThis is a bit overkill, but I think it's very time-consuming task to rewrite the primitive crypto implementation. \r\n\r\n1. When Out of Memory happen, the normal check is to make an early exit. By chance, this would make the primitive crypto continue to run and perhaps able to generate a signature. \r\ne.g: A hash tree requires memory allocation to compute the root, somehow the memory allocation fails, the root is returned with garbage value. Because it's hash, there is no way to distinguish random and garbage stack memory. \r\nPerhaps we should treat this as black box, when primitive crypto out of memory, EXIT the program. \r\n2. This approach will make using a crypto primitive a pain in the ass to the application. Abrupt exit is normally unacceptable. But when it's out of memory, would we choose to stop generate crypto or.. continue to generate the incorrect one? \r\n\r\n\r\nOf course these two problems can be solved if we refactor crypto primitives to return all the way to the top level like Rust language does. With C, I don't know how. \r\n\r\nOkay, so that's why you see me use normal `malloc` and NULL check. \r\nI can always switch to `OQS_checked_malloc` APIs in the `XMSS/external`. \r\nLet me know. \r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\nSome formats here and there to make astyle happy, and convert `TODO` lines to `TODO (from upstream)` because it's not from me. \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.
