Since this is major, I think it would be nice to have it under its own file (or set of files).\r\noqsprov/oqsprov.c and oqsprov/oqsprov_keys.c are already large.\r\n> \r\n> I also suggest that we split your code into smaller functions, in order to improve reading and to factor some bit of code.\r\n\r\nI tend to agree, @thb-sb -- but you also state that the code/files even before this PR is large (mea culpa)... So what about the suggestion to create an issue for doing a \"general\" refactoring (also of the existing \"hybrid\" code) but let this PR land first to not \"overload\" it with tasks (that also would sensibly done to other parts of the code)? Secondary benefit of this approach: If @feventura does not volunteer to do it, the person doing the refactoring gets a much better grip on the code than is possible by reviewing alone.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-09T15:47:29Z","updated_at":"2024-03-09T15:47:29Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/317#discussion_r1518604009","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/317","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/1518604009"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/317#discussion_r1518604009"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/317"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/1518604009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":1,"original_line":1,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1516538470,"original_position":1,"position":1,"subject_type":"file"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/317","id":1641480680,"node_id":"PR_kwDOE_A9l85h1wHo","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/317","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/317.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/317.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/317","number":317,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Implementation
