The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1599\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1599\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

compile with `-DOQS_ALGS_ENABLED=STD`, ~~I expect both ml-dsa-44-ipd and its alias ml-dsa-44 to be available, although only the alias was specified in the \"STD\" list.~~ ml-dsa-44 is added to the STD list but not ml-dsa-44-ipd\r\n\r\nIt's addressed by refactoring alg_support.cmake and the fragments that generate it, by moving the cmake statements to conditionally activate platform-specific code and aliases below the calls to \"filter_algs\". filter_algs would otherwise remove these dependencies.\r\n\r\nAdds a test to CI to check if both a ml-dsa-ipd and a ml-dsa alias is available with the STD build.\r\n\r\nAdds missing bike_l5 to the NIST_R4 algs list (unless this variant wasn't there intentionally).\r\n\r\nFixes #1703 \r\nFixes #1704\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `OQS_DLOPEN_OPENSSL` build option to use OpenSSL through dynamically loaded libcrypto.so.* with dlopen, instead of linking to the library at build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Whenever we have implementations of SLH-DSA and NTRU-DSA (or whatever other name NIST settles on for Falcon) we can add them to this list of stables names too.\r\n\r\nSorry, I should have caught this on my first pass.","created_at":"2024-03-07T16:16:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-07T16:16:58Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1721#discussion_r1516446450","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1721","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1516446450"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1721#discussion_r1516446450"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1721"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1516446450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":null,"original_line":45,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1516345426,"original_position":7,"position":null,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1721","id":1760684822,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5o8esW","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1721","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1721.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1721.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1721","number":1721,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"improve algorithm documentation [skip ci]","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Fixes #1564 : @dstebila please check whether this is enough to close out the remaining blocker for the release of 0.10.0.

If NIST changes the implementation details of these algorithms, `liboqs` will adapt the implementation such as for users to not be impacted by such potential change. For users interested in explicitly selecting the current \"proposed draft standard\" code, the variants with the suffix \"-ipd\" are made available. At this stage, \"ml-kem-ipd\" and \"ml-kem\" as well as \"ml-dsa-ipd\" and \"ml-dsa\" are functionally equivalent, denoted by the \"alias\" moniker below.","path":"README.md","commit_id":"303c3a27cc9eca26e36877a509d3223e969b1040","original_commit_id":"303c3a27cc9eca26e36877a509d3223e969b1040","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"```suggestion\r\nThe only algorithms in `liboqs` that implement NIST standards drafts are the [`ML-KEM`](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd) and [`ML-DSA`](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd) variants with their respective different bit strengths. `liboqs` will retain these algorithm names selected by NIST throughout the finishing stages of the standardization process, so users can rely on their presence going forward.

0.10.0.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T10:02:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-07T19:19:07Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39c8eb54c40f91f661a97423130008a20e023ec6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/milestones/23/labels","id":9830315,"node_id":"MI_kwDOA-eq3c4Alf-r","number":23,"title":"0.10.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":22,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-23T17:18:24Z","updated_at":"2024-03-07T15:48:56Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1721/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1721/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1721/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/10fd5641aff0478d40d04329c8949bb0ae81b382","head":{"label":"open-quantum-safe:mb-docupdate","ref":"mb-docupdate","sha":"10fd5641aff0478d40d04329c8949bb0ae81b382","user":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65514205,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTUxNDIwNQ==","name":"liboqs","full_name":"open-quantum-safe/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs","description":"C
