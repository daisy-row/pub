By saying _the separation of the classical algorithm key pair and the post-quantum algorithm key pair_ I assume you're talking about the case when you have generated an hybrid key (for instance `p521_dilithium5`).\r\n> \r\n> I've tried to find a way using the OpenSSL API to extract the PQ key from an hybrid key, but I couldn't. The only way I found is to use [`EVP_PKEY_get_attr_by_OBJ`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/EVP_PKEY_get_attr_by_OBJ.html), but it requires you to know by advance the `OBJ` corresponding to the PQ or the classical algorithm (this OBJ can be retrieved at runtime though).\r\n> \r\n> However, I'm pretty sure we can develop a more \"elegant\" way of doing this by using the [`OSSL_PARAM`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/OSSL_PARAM.html) API, with [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/EVP_PKEY_get_params.html). Right now, the following parameters are returned by [`EVP_PKEY_get_params`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.2/man3/EVP_PKEY_get_params.html) on a `p521_dilithium5` key:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> $ OPENSSL_MODULES=/Users/thomas.bailleux/work/oqs-provider/build/lib/ ./poc\r\n> key=bits\r\n> type=1\r\n> key=security-bits\r\n> type=1\r\n> key=max-size\r\n> type=1\r\n> key=encoded-pub-key\r\n> type=5\r\n> key=pub\r\n> type=5\r\n> key=priv\r\n> type=5\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I think for hybrid `EVP_PKEY`s, we can have two additional pairs of parameters called for instance `classical_<TYPE>` and `pq_<TYPE>`, where `<TYPE>` is `pub` or `priv`.\r\n> \r\n> What do you think @baentsch ?\r\n\r\nI also find that  [EVP_PKEY_get_params] is a pretty good way to separete pkey,but I am not quiet clear  the  structure of params.So I am trying to use it .","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1997078763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-03-14T10:04:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
