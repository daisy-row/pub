I'm absolutely baffled by what I see: The httpd server in your setup properly responds to queries fielded by an equivalent `oqsprovider` build/client, e.g.,\r\n\r\n    docker run --network epiphany_default -it openquantumsafe/curl sh -c \"openssl s_client --connect epiphany-server-1:4433 -groups kyber768\"\r\n\r\nAlso, the epiphany (browser) image in your composition properly operates `openssl` and `oqsprovider` when logging in to it via `docker exec`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl list -providers -verbose\r\nProviders:\r\n  default\r\n    name: OpenSSL Default Provider\r\n    version: 3.3.0\r\n    status: active\r\n    build info: 3.3.0-dev\r\n    gettable provider parameters:\r\n      name: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      version: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      buildinfo: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      status: integer (arbitrary size)\r\n  oqsprovider\r\n    name: OpenSSL OQS Provider\r\n    version: 0.5.4-dev\r\n    status: active\r\n    build info: OQS Provider v.0.5.4-dev (510fea6) based on liboqs v.0.10.0-dev\r\n    gettable provider parameters:\r\n      name: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      version: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      buildinfo: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      status: integer (arbitrary size)\r\nopenssl s_client -connect test.openquantumsafe.org:6036 -groups kyber768\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Just\" when putting the two things together, i.e., using the known-good local `openssl` code against the known-good `oqs-httpd`, things fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_client -connect epiphany-server-1:4433 -groups kyber768\r\nConnecting to 172.18.0.3\r\nCONNECTED(00000003)\r\n40F761B92B7F0000:error:0A000410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:ssl/tls alert handshake failure:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:907:SSL alert number 40\r\n---\r\nno peer certificate available\r\n---\r\nNo client certificate CA names sent\r\n---\r\nSSL handshake has read 7 bytes and written 1425 bytes\r\nVerification: OK\r\n---\r\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\r\nThis TLS version forbids renegotiation.\r\nCompression: NONE\r\nExpansion: NONE\r\nNo ALPN negotiated\r\nEarly data was not sent\r\nVerify return code: 0 (ok)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`oqs-epiphany` then not working is a logical consequence. But the issue is somewhere else. Will need to debug into this...\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/265#issuecomment-1945625104_\r\n            ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/266/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/2025221701","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/266#issuecomment-2025221701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/266","id":2025221701,"node_id":"IC_kwDODP--n854tm5F","user":{"login":"jellejurre","id":76777936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Nzc3OTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76777936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre","html_url":"https://github.com/jellejurre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellejurre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-28T13:43:15Z","updated_at":"2024-03-28T13:43:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"yeah I think I might be putting the provider in the wrong place or something.
