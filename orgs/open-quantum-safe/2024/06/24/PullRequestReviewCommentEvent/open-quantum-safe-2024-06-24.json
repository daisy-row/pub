(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/ossf/scorecard it's possible some additional permissions may be needed (depending on branch rotection setup).  These can be dealt with as a second iteration\r\n\r\nThis PR also does not attempt to address any findings from the scorecard scan.

This is\n+ to make maintenance easier, but it is not used at script execution time.\n+\n+ The `pip-compile` tool must be installed via the [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) package.\n+ \n+ To add a new, or changed dependency:\n+ ```\n+ pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in\n+ ```\n+\n+ This will update requirements.txt with the correct hashes.\n+\n+ Correction function should be verified, and then both `requirements.txt` and `requirements.in` checked in.\n+\n+### Github Actions\n+\n+All actions used in `.github/worfklows' should pin the exact version of the action they are using, for\n+example a step such as:\n+\n+```yaml\n+- name: Checkout code\n+  uses: actions/checkout@0ad4b8fadaa221de15dcec353f45205ec38ea70b # pin@v4\n+```\n+\n+The exact hash specified after `@` is the git commit hash within the repo where the action is found.\n+\n+The [pin github action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action) tool can be used to maintain these\n+by, for example, running:\n+\n+```shell\n+pin-github-action unix.yml\n+```\n+\n+This will update the hashes with the latest version if no pinned value is set.","path":"docs/PROCEDURES.md","commit_id":"827e2d7fcd0b9e5766d47151cfd8833b53051841","original_commit_id":"827e2d7fcd0b9e5766d47151cfd8833b53051841","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"For completion of the if condition, may be worth while adding \"This tool does nothing if a pinned value has been set.\"?","created_at":"2024-06-24T05:21:20Z","updated_at":"2024-06-24T05:21:20Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1708#discussion_r1650352736","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1708","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1650352736"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1708#discussion_r1650352736"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1708"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1650352736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":57,"original_line":57,"side":"RIGHT","original_position":57,"position":57,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1708","id":1745276400,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5oBs3w","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1708","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1708.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1708.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1708","number":1708,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Create scorecard.yml (OpenSSF)","user":{"login":"planetf1","id":7292002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTIwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7292002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1","html_url":"https://github.com/planetf1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\nAdds a github action to run the OpenSSF scorecard tool, and posts results to security->code scanning\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

This is\n+ to make maintenance easier, but it is not used at script execution time.\n+\n+ The `pip-compile` tool must be installed via the [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) package.\n+ \n+ To add a new, or changed dependency:\n+ ```\n+ pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in\n+ ```\n+\n+ This will update requirements.txt with the correct hashes.\n+\n+ Correction function should be verified, and then both `requirements.txt` and `requirements.in` checked in.\n+\n+### Github Actions\n+\n+All actions used in `.github/worfklows' should pin the exact version of the action they are using, for\n+example a step such as:\n+\n+```yaml\n+- name: Checkout code\n+  uses: actions/checkout@0ad4b8fadaa221de15dcec353f45205ec38ea70b #

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/ossf/scorecard it's possible some additional permissions may be needed (depending on branch rotection setup).

This is\n+ to make maintenance easier, but it is not used at script execution time.\n+\n+ The `pip-compile` tool must be installed via the [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) package.\n+ \n+ To add a new, or changed dependency:\n+ ```\n+ pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in\n+ ```\n+\n+ This will update requirements.txt with the correct hashes.\n+\n+ Correction function should be verified, and then both `requirements.txt` and `requirements.in` checked in.\n+\n+### Github Actions\n+\n+All actions used in `.github/worfklows' should pin the exact version of the action they are using, for\n+example a step such as:\n+\n+```yaml\n+- name: Checkout code\n+  uses: actions/checkout@0ad4b8fadaa221de15dcec353f45205ec38ea70b # pin@v4\n+```\n+\n+The exact hash specified after `@` is the git commit hash within the repo where the action is found.\n+\n+The [pin github action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action) tool can be used to maintain these\n+by, for example, running:\n+\n+```shell\n+pin-github-action unix.yml\n+```\n+\n+This will update the hashes with the latest version if no pinned value is set.\n+\n+For major updates, update the comment ie `pin@v4` to `pin@v5` and the tool will attempt to find the new hash.\n+\n+To help in explanation here's an example of a similar code fragment between tool executions:\n+\n+* Original entry is `uses: actions/checkout@v3`\n+* run `pin-github-action unix.yml`\n+* We now see `uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744 # pin@v3`\n+* later we want to go to v4, so update the text to `uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744 # pin@v4`\n+* Now run `pin-github-action unix.yml` to correct the sha\n+* File now shows `uses: actions/checkout@692973e3d937129bcbf40652eb9f2f61becf3332 # pin@v4`","path":"docs/PROCEDURES.md","commit_id":"827e2d7fcd0b9e5766d47151cfd8833b53051841","original_commit_id":"827e2d7fcd0b9e5766d47151cfd8833b53051841","user":{"login":"planetf1","id":7292002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTIwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7292002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1","html_url":"https://github.com/planetf1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"yes, that's right.\r\n\r\nWe may start with 'actions/myaction@2.1'\r\nThen run the tool and get `actions/myaction@a1b2c3d4 # pin@2.1' (etc)\r\nThen run the tool again and get `actions/myaction@e5f6a1 # pin@2.1' if there's a new update that is still 2.1\r\nBut to go to 2.2, I'd update the 'pin@2.1' comment to 'pin@2.2'\r\n\r\nThis tool felt reasonable to use when I was making the changes, and reduces the effort.

This is\n+ to make maintenance easier, but it is not used at script execution time.\n+\n+ The `pip-compile` tool must be installed via the [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) package.\n+ \n+ To add a new, or changed dependency:\n+ ```\n+ pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in\n+ ```\n+\n+ This will update requirements.txt with the correct hashes.\n+\n+ Correction function should be verified, and then both `requirements.txt` and `requirements.in` checked in.\n+\n+### Github Actions\n+\n+All actions used in `.github/worfklows' should pin the exact version of the action they are using, for\n+example a step such as:\n+\n+```yaml\n+- name: Checkout code\n+  uses: actions/checkout@0ad4b8fadaa221de15dcec353f45205ec38ea70b # pin@v4\n+```\n+\n+The exact hash specified after `@` is the git commit hash within the repo where the action is found.\n+\n+The [pin github action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action) tool can be used to maintain these\n+by, for example, running:\n+\n+```shell\n+pin-github-action unix.yml\n+```\n+\n+This will update the hashes with the latest version if no pinned value is set.\n+\n+For major updates, update the comment ie `pin@v4` to `pin@v5` and the tool will attempt to find the new hash.\n+\n+To help in explanation here's an example of a similar code fragment between tool executions:\n+\n+* Original entry is `uses: actions/checkout@v3`\n+* run `pin-github-action unix.yml`\n+* We now see `uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744 # pin@v3`\n+* later we want to go to v4, so update the text to `uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744 # pin@v4`\n+* Now run `pin-github-action unix.yml` to correct the sha\n+* File now shows `uses: actions/checkout@692973e3d937129bcbf40652eb9f2f61becf3332 # pin@v4`","path":"docs/PROCEDURES.md","commit_id":"373d17ff6c66d1df0c113a7902cfaa905056a4f2","original_commit_id":"827e2d7fcd0b9e5766d47151cfd8833b53051841","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"It sure does.
