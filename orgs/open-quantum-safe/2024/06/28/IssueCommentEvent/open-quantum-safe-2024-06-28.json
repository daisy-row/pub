But of course _any_ contributions are welcome.\r\n\r\nI will (continue to) intentionally refrain from contributing too much to gauge whether there's true \"community interest\" in this or whether this sub project should be left to wither away. For the avoidance of doubt, I'd find the latter wrong as it will weaken OQS -- but I simply don't have the power any more to keep maintaining this single-handedly. Also my motivation is not increased witnessing things like the below:\r\n\r\nAdding/documenting in writing here your verbal statement from the meeting @ajbozarth that IBM has \"many OQS-based demos\" in-house that it may consider contributing -- and I have a hunch that other companies have/do the same.\r\n\r\nI heard this comment with great sorrow: Isn't FOSS most powerful when people (and companies) work together? The community could grow and learn; OQS in this case could benefit; lots of duplicate effort could be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis comment goes to all corporate members of PQCA (@dstebila @thb-sb please carry this plea to the TAC and GB): Please seriously consider contributing integrations of an OSS library (OQS) into other OSS libraries to the OSS community earlier than later. Proprietary code integrations may of course stay proprietary to afford \"competitive advantage\". I'd still personally consider the latter wrong as this wastes resources (many companies paying many people to do the same thing), introduces risks (proprietary integrations not gaining enough scrutiny to assure proper security standing) and doesn't strengthen a commonly used OSS component (OQS in this case not getting feedback from secret integrations). Allow me to tag @bencemali and his team and company as a great (counter)example: They seem to use OQS, contribute their findings and motivate changes to OQS based on their use -- all the while pursuing their own product(s). Big Thanks! This is how I understand FOSS to work for everyone and which motivates me to keep contributing.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Also I have no permissions on this repo and can't update the labels or assignee on this issue.\r\n\r\nOQS originally had the common FOSS \"meritocracy\" principle: People that contribute & maintain got GH management rights. The LF take-over did away with this, though: Even I as \"maintainer\" (call me MINO :-) can't give you those permissions. Hence tagging @ryjones to give @ajbozarth or anyone else any GH permissions they want on this project: IMO this sub project will never be considered [sensitive for productive use](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1) so I see no risk in this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/2196206453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-28T06:06:28Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

for this report. Unfortunately, `oqsprovider` does not modify any key representation but simply \"shuffles around\" (the openssl provider APIs) completely opaque binary blobs/what's provided by `liboqs` (APIs). And _that_ in turn takes its code from the [pqcrystals](https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium) repository. So tagging @bhess as the contact person to that code base for comment as to whether it's permissible to retain an unused parameter as NULL or whether it indeed has to be left away. What might be helpful is a reference to the specifications (pertaining to Dilithium and its key representation format) that you have been using when implementing your CA code, @stauro79 such as to compare the relevant parts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2197177268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-28T15:26:45Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
