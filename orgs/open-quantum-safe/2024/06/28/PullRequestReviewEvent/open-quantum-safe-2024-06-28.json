This fork ensures that we can build static oqs-provider libraries for all platforms.\r\n\r\nSpecific changes:\r\n* Ignore 'build' and 'tmp' folders from git\r\n* Modify CMakeLists.txt per https://stackoverflow.com/a/73886192/1318024 (Android Toolchain problems)\r\n* Permit explicit setting for liboqs header via optional CMake var LIBOQS_INCLUDE_DIR\r\n* #include <stdint.h> to ensure that uint64_t and friends are defined.\r\n* Generic wrapper build script for creating builds for all the macOS / iOS / Android platforms we use. The build script requires that liboqs is cloned and built.\r\n\r\nThe required changes include the <stdint.h> include and the CMakeLists mods.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nThere are no known issues hit by this PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Example: `build/export/apple/0.10.0-dev/macosx/arm64/include`\r\n* Libraries are always built static and macOS / iOS libraries include all required architectures.\r\n* Script can be invoked with any of the included functions; by default, builds all platforms and creates export output.\r\n\r\nThe output from the script can be used as-is with the analogous script for the `oqs-provider` project - there is a separate PR for that project.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\nNo \r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\nNo new features added. The script requires access to a versioned openssl with subfolders to each platform.\r\nExamples:\r\n* Android - `[dir]/android/3.2.1` with subfolders similar to `arm64-v8a/{include,lib}`\r\n* Apple - `[dir]/apple/3.2.1` with subfolders similar to `iphoneos/{include,lib}`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-01T19:16:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T12:09:22Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e87b98ef59d555f390b1c88492c67e9a04d4da5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/e6e0cab08d8805f85bef39f8dad49ab450dd879e","head":{"label":"andybrucenet:main","ref":"main","sha":"e6e0cab08d8805f85bef39f8dad49ab450dd879e","user":{"login":"andybrucenet","id":374301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet","html_url":"https://github.com/andybrucenet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":764813412,"node_id":"R_kgDOLZYgZA","name":"liboqs","full_name":"andybrucenet/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andybrucenet","id":374301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet","html_url":"https://github.com/andybrucenet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andybrucenet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andybrucenet/liboqs","description":"C
