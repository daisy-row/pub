An integration of xmss/lms to `oqs-provider` also is [only in discussion stage](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/331) AFAIK (you just witnessed the \"merging\" pains of the integration of those algs into `liboqs`, not yet to `oqs-provider`).

But again, I've been pretty alone working on these integrations and thus somewhat put them on the back burner (I'm motivated by cooperation and that's hard being the only guy :-). From a first glance-over of the IBM code, it might benefit from a resolution of #182 as it still uses the no longer supported OpenSSL111 code base. As you noticed I've been updating `nginx` and `curl` to use `openssl3` with `oqs-provider` (primarily for testing that code base and making available our interop test server) but there seem to be more moving parts in the IBM project. So I'm afraid, you should ask for help there (and/or suggest them contributing to OQS and maintaining this ingress integration for the benefit of the wider community here: I'm personally not very motivated to work for free on code owned by a multi-billion-$ profit company :-)\r\n\r\nSo the best advice to you that I can give is that you try to merge the Dockerfile logic in our `nginx` integration with the kubernetes code.
