When I use scripts/fullbuild.sh with openssl-3.3 branch (given as an environment var) it cannot clone the relevant branch, and the connection times out after a while. I changed the link from \"git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git\" to \"https://git.openssl.org/openssl.git\" and it worked. BTW, to download liboqs the script uses the link with https protocol, but I don't know why this link for openssl starts with a \"git\". It may or may not be a bug, but I wanted to report it anyways.\r\n\r\n**Hints**\r\nTo exclude a build/setup error, please consider running your test\r\ncommands to reproduce the problem in our [pre-build docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3/general),\r\ne.g. as such: `docker run -it openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3` and\r\nprovide full command input and output traces in the bug report.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-04T06:33:37Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
