Problem permeates through the complete OQS stack, see [open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#427](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/427) and [open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos#281](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/281) . Possible work-around [discussed here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/427#issuecomment-2157249645). A better solution of course is needed, see [comment here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1817#pullrequestreview-2106361120): downstream-triggering CI should have caught this; still wonder why it didn't (ideas @SWilson4 ?)\r\n\r\nI believe that it would have, but I think we (I really, as I was the one who merged the PR) simply missed manually triggering the downstream tests before merge. The trigger was broken through the final stages of the review, but I believe it was fixed before merge, so the tests should have been run.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2160991137/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-11T15:01:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
