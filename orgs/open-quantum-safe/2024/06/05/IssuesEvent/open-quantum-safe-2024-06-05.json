When I use scripts/fullbuild.sh with openssl-3.3 branch (given as an environment var) it cannot clone the relevant branch, and the connection times out after a while. I changed the link from \"git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git\" to \"https://git.openssl.org/openssl.git\" and it worked. BTW, to download liboqs the script uses the link with https protocol, but I don't know why this link for openssl starts with a \"git\".

An example is a recent regression in the [Kyber/ML-KEM](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/hqbtIGFKIpU/m/cnE3pbueBgAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer&pli=1) reference code, when using clang >= v15 on x86_64 and compiler options -Os, -O1, -O2 -fno-vectorize or -O3 -fno-vectorize.\r\n\r\nThe liboqs constant-time tooling would be able to detect the above issue, but CI runs the test only on a single platform, with one compiler (gcc) and with one configuration (cmake DEBUG).\r\n\r\nTo cover such cases, the suggestion would be to run the tests with different variables (e.g., in weekly tests). For example:\r\n- Architectures: x86_64 and ARM (as suggested by @SWilson4 in the last developers call)\r\n- Generic and assembly-optimized code (as already done in CI for x86_64)\r\n- Compilers: gcc and clang using different versions (e.g., system default version and latest available version)\r\n- Optimization levels: -Os, -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3 (or instead, using the cmake default options: Debug, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO, RELEASE)\r\n- Additional compiler flags (e.g., -fno-vectorize)\r\n\r\nI think it's unrealistic to be really exhaustive, but it should be document which configurations were tested (and what the limitations of the tests are).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1807/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-05T11:35:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
