This is\n+ to make maintenance easier, but it is not used at script execution time.\n+\n+ The `pip-compile` tool must be installed via the [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) package.\n+ \n+ To add a new, or changed dependency:\n+ ```\n+ pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in\n+ ```\n+\n+ This will update requirements.txt with the correct hashes.\n+\n+ Correction function should be verified, and then both `requirements.txt` and `requirements.in` checked in.\n+\n+### Github Actions\n+\n+All actions used in `.github/worfklows' should pin the exact version of the action they are using, for\n+example a step such as:\n+\n+```yaml\n+- name: Checkout code\n+  uses: actions/checkout@0ad4b8fadaa221de15dcec353f45205ec38ea70b # pin@v4\n+```\n+\n+The exact hash specified after `@` is the git commit hash within the repo where the action is found.\n+\n+The [pin github action](https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action) tool can be used to maintain these\n+by, for example, running:\n+\n+```shell\n+pin-github-action unix.yml\n+```\n+\n+This will update the hashes with the latest version if no pinned value is set.\n+\n+For major updates, update the comment ie `pin@v4` to `pin@v5` and the tool will attempt to find the new hash.\n+\n+To help in explanation here's an example of a similar code fragment between tool executions:\n+\n+* Original entry is `uses: actions/checkout@v3`\n+* run `pin-github-action unix.yml`\n+* We now see `uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744 # pin@v3`\n+* later we want to go to v4, so update the text to `uses: actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744 # pin@v4`\n+* Now run `pin-github-action unix.yml` to correct the sha\n+* File now shows `uses: actions/checkout@692973e3d937129bcbf40652eb9f2f61becf3332 # pin@v4`","path":"docs/PROCEDURES.md","commit_id":"373d17ff6c66d1df0c113a7902cfaa905056a4f2","original_commit_id":"827e2d7fcd0b9e5766d47151cfd8833b53051841","user":{"login":"planetf1","id":7292002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTIwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7292002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1","html_url":"https://github.com/planetf1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Updated comments for first para.\r\n\r\nOn the second topic, agree, it would be something to look into.
