Teach users how to use OQS\r\n2. Aid the OQS project, such as use in CI\r\n3. Prover users a stable starting point for using OQS\r\n\r\n## Current State of the project (provided by @baentsch )\r\n\r\n- All demos have a Dockerfile except the `chromium` demo since it's build can take up to 15 hours and would be unusable in CI\r\n- `curl` and `nginx` demos are the most important and maintained, and are used by the test server\r\n- `httpd` is supported because it is simple\r\n\r\n## Future \r\n\r\n- @baentsch : get all the current demos running and up to date for use in CI\r\n- @ajbozarth : can we update the Dockerfiles to leverage a base image with liboqs/provider?\r\n   - @baentsch : We intentionally don't use a base image because most demos use different configurations for liboqs and the provider. To some degree this is \"intentionally diverse\" for CI\r\n- @ajbozarth : should we keep the current demos in separate directories in one repo format?\r\n   - separate directories allow easy removal of deprecated demos (will remain in git history)\r\n   - separate repos is overkill for most demos, but could be useful if a specific demo becomes \"large\" enough\r\n\r\n- Core purpose: CI and user tutorials\r\n- Project Goal: Move the demo contents to their upstream projects. This would mean meeting with those project teams to coordinate once demos are back up to date\r\n- Long-term Goal (ie 2-5 years): Complete deprecation of the demos repo as all PQ support exists out of the box in the upstream projects\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n@ajbozarth will draft a proposal based on the above discussion and present it at a future OQS Status meeting in addition to posting it here for discussion. Aiming for July 9th meeting, but may take longer due to holidays.\r\n\r\nOnce the proposal is generally accepted, @ajbozarth and any other volunteers will start executing on it.
