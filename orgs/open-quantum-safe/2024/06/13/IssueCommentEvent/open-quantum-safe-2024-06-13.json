Please feel free to iterate on it if you find an ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThanks! But I still don't quite understand how to proceed from RC to final release though: Do I get it right that I'd now have to wait for an OQS meeting to confirm the RC is OK? What about having concrete acceptance criteria or remote approvals by someone allowing this to be faster? Who would this be? I'm the sole maintainer but have been stripped of the github admin rights required to proceed as per the Wiki.\r\n\r\nAnyway, after this RC approval, would I then\r\n- have to create a new PR removing the \"-rc\" monikers from the corresponding files (at least RELEASE.md)?\r\n- get that PR approved\r\n- merge the PR\r\n- create final release\r\n?\r\n\r\nThis sounds pretty complicated: I must be missing something. Was it incorrect for me to merge the 061rc1 branch to main and do the RC on that commit? Was it incorrect to have rc monikers in any file? Or should I have created the RC1 on this branch (not yet merging to main), waiting for it to be approved somehow, then fix it up to be final (remove rc monikers) and only then merge-and-release? Do you have a write-up somewhere how  `liboqs` \"main\" branch releases are done so that I can learn from that? I only know about [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Release-process) and it's also silent about these steps.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2164513200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-13T06:03:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

But I still don't quite understand how to proceed from RC to final release though: Do I get it right that I'd now have to wait for an OQS meeting to confirm the RC is OK? What about having concrete acceptance criteria or remote approvals by someone allowing this to be faster? Who would this be? I'm the sole maintainer but have been stripped of the github admin rights required to proceed as per the Wiki.\r\n\r\nI'll admit that I was deliberately ambiguous on that point, as I don't believe there are concrete acceptance criteria currently. (And I'd prefer not to come up with them on my own and codify them as a \"benevolent dictator.\" :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)\r\n\r\n> Anyway, after this RC approval, would I then\r\n> \r\n>     * have to create a new PR removing the \"-rc\" monikers from the corresponding files (at least RELEASE.md)?\r\n> \r\n>     * get that PR approved\r\n> \r\n>     * merge the PR\r\n> \r\n>     * create final release\r\n>       ?\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> This sounds pretty complicated: I must be missing something. Was it incorrect for me to merge the 061rc1 branch to main and do the RC on that commit? Was it incorrect to have rc monikers in any file? Or should I have created the RC1 on this branch (not yet merging to main), waiting for it to be approved somehow, then fix it up to be final (remove rc monikers) and only then merge-and-release? Do you have a write-up somewhere how `liboqs` \"main\" branch releases are done so that I can learn from that? I only know about [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Release-process) and it's also silent about these steps.\r\n\r\nThat seemed to me be the quickest and easiest way to get the \"-rc\" suffixes out of the necessary files without pushing directly to `main`. Perhaps it is not ideal for future releases, but for this one I think it's the best way forward.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's a standardized procedure for `liboqs` releases from `main` either... At least, it was done differently for 0.9.0 and 0.10.0. For 0.9.0 former, the release candidate PR was merged into `main`, and then the final release was committed directly to main (just removing `-rc1` from everything). For 0.10.0, I believe that the release candidate branch was not merged until the `-rc` suffixes had been removed.\r\n\r\nMy preference for future releases from `main` would be to work on an `rc` branch which is only merged into `main` after it's been approved (both by PR approvals and whatever hypothetical criteria) and had the `-rc*` versioning suffixes removed. The final release tag would correspond to the merge commit. This means that there is only one PR and no direct commits to `main` required. What do you think of this approach? I can take a stab at editing the wiki(s) to codify the process.\r\n\r\nSorry for any confusion I've caused with the wiki edits; I really am trying to streamline things as much as I can without overstepping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2166685043/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-06-13T20:13:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
