More information on OQS can be found on the website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**oqs-provider** is a standalone [OpenSSL 3](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)-based quantum-safe and [hybrid key exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology) for TLS 1.3, as well as quantum-safe and hybrid X.509 certificate generation, CMS, CMP and `dgst` (signature) operations.\r\n\r\nWhen deployed, the `oqs-provider` binary (shared library) thus adds support for quantum-safe cryptographic operations to any standard OpenSSL(v3) installation. The ultimate goal is that all `openssl` functionality shall be [PQC-enabled](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).\r\n\r\nIn general, the oqs-provider `main` branch is meant to be usable in conjunction with the `main` branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and the `master` branch of [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).\r\n\r\nFurther details on building, testing and use can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.6.1 of oqs-provider. This version is closely in sync with `liboqs` v.0.10.1.\r\n\r\nMost important updates are fixed references to a security update to `liboqs`, fixes of potential buffer overrun errors in hybrid key decoding, adding of composite OID setting logic and several documentation updates.\r\n\r\n### Security considerations\r\n\r\nThis fixes potential buffer overrun problems in hybrid key decoding. Use of prior versions is strongly discouraged.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* reverting to dev mode [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/394\r\n* add caveat regarding OpenSSL installs [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/402\r\n* cpack x64 CI fix by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/401\r\n* Add PKCS#12 test by @iyanmv in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/400\r\n* Fix CI (Add Ubuntu 24 support) by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/410\r\n* Bump jinja2 from 3.1.3 to 3.1.4 in /oqs-template by @dependabot in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/409\r\n* Extra parentheses removed by @bencemali in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/405\r\n* No unwanted error left in queue from OBJ_create by @bencemali in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/404\r\n* update security issue reporting [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/414\r\n* DECODE_UINT32 without lengths checked fixed by @bencemali in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416\r\n* add composite OIDs to getenv logic by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/419\r\n* Switch to https for git access by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/423\r\n* STANDARDS.md update by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/420\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @iyanmv made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/400\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/compare/0.6.0...0.6.1\r\n","mentions_count":4,"mentions":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15230534?v=4","login":"iyanmv","profile_name":"Iyán","profile_url":"https://github.com/iyanmv","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27347476?v=4","login":"dependabot","profile_name":"Dependabot","profile_url":"https://github.com/dependabot","avatar_user_actor":false},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","login":"baentsch","profile_name":"Michael Baentsch","profile_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64798108?v=4","login":"bencemali","profile_name":"Bence Mali","profile_url":"https://github.com/bencemali","avatar_user_actor":true}],"short_description_html":"<h1>oqs-provider 0.6.1</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
