For example in case of Kyber/ML-KEM one can do a workaround roughly like this in oqs-provider's oqsx_key_op function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if (strcmp(key->tls_name, \"mlkem1024\") == 0) {\r\n                memcpy(key->pubkey, (char *)key->privkey + 1536,\r\n                       key->pubkeylen);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea for this issue is that liboqs could provide a unified interface for recreating the public key from the private key, when it is possible. For example, a function like this could be added to kem.h in liboqs:\r\n\r\n`OQS_API OQS_STATUS OQS_KEM_recreate_pub_from_priv(const OQS_KEM *kem, uint8_t *secret_key, uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAnd in the OQS_KEM structure, for each algorithm a new function could be registered:\r\n\r\n`OQS_STATUS (*recreate)(const uint8_t *secret_key, const uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAdding this functionality could reduce serialized key sizes for some algorithms. This is a rough idea and I just want to ask for the opinions of the folks involved in oqs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2169254935","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802#issuecomment-2169254935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802","id":2169254935,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c6BTDQX","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-15T09:57:09Z","updated_at":"2024-06-15T09:57:09Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> OK, I've not been asked but I have an opinion regardless: YOLOing taking the risk my comment gets deleted :-) here we go:\r\n> \r\n> > oqs-provider still by default attaches the public key to the serialization of the private key, which can be turned off with the NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY macro [...]\r\n> > reduce serialized key sizes for some algorithms.\r\n> \r\n> This at its core seems to be a question regarding (external) key representation which is not an issue `liboqs` wants to deal with if I'm not mistaken, @dstebila ? I also agree with @SWilson4 that such a \"key recovery\" API not working for all algs adds support hassles. Also it may have some security implications we may want to think through first...\r\n\r\nMy first reaction is that, within liboqs itself, I would want to go for a representation that's as close to what NIST advises as possible.  Higher level consumers of liboqs (including oqs-provider) could then decide to use a different representation if they want.  For oqs-provider, I guess the question would come down to: what interoperability do consumers of OpenSSL 3 oqs-provider expect for their keys?  For that matter, does the provider interface allow for different serialization formats for the same keying material?  And then having made that decision, it might come back to liboqs that an additional support function is required.
