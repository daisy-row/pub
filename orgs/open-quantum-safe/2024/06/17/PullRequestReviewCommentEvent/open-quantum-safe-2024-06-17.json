It's only effect is\r\n - small amount of resource to run the workflow\r\n - creates items under Security->code scanning, visible to those with 'write' access in the repo\r\n\r\nNo branch protection rules are being changed to require successful completion of this action\r\n \r\n No additional testing is required\r\n \r\n Example output is shown in the referenced issue\r\n \r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/ossf/scorecard it's possible some additional permissions may be needed (depending on branch rotection setup).  These can be dealt with as a second iteration\r\n\r\nThis PR also does not attempt to address any findings from the scorecard scan. It's purely activating the tool so that we can review and act on those findings subsequently.\r\n\r\nDraft for\r\n - testing\r\n - minor changes/comments

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [NO] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nAs per https://github.com/ossf/scorecard it's possible some additional permissions may be needed (depending on branch rotection setup).  These can be dealt with as a second iteration\r\n\r\nThis PR also does not attempt to address any findings from the scorecard scan.
