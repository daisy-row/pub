drastic, no? Would you suggest also disabling the hybrid and composite variants, @mouse07410 ? @beldmit: What'd be your position: You seem to have taken to using some of the (now) \"historic\" variants of PQCrystals algs: Would you also be OK if we'd disable them by default? Any objections, @dstebila ? Researchers can always re-enable algs they need, but normal users should not be negatively impacted by shenanigans like these, so I currently tend to support this proposal.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a bit drastic to disable everything except ML-DSA. I'm not sure what the right combination is, but hopefully we can get a reasonable mix in.

That'd be pretty drastic, no?\r\n\r\nGiven that the only working alternative seems to be disabling the `oqs-provider` altogether - probably not that drastic. Of course, I'm all ears to hear what options you can recommend.\r\n\r\n**Situation**:\r\n- Having majority of the supported algorithms enabled breaks at least some public widely-used TLS servers;\r\n- NIST standardized a fairly small subset of digital signatures, and even among those not all seem suitable for TLS;\r\n- \"normal\" users (IMHO) aren't likely to need non-NIST algorithms anyway.\r\n\r\n**What currently works**:\r\nI've successfully tested the following (using modifications proposed by @iyanmv above):\r\n- All ML-DSA parameters; plus\r\n- All Falcon parameters; plus\r\n- Dilithium5; plus\r\n- All the KEM algorithms available (simply because they didn't seem to make any difference).\r\n\r\n> Would you suggest also disabling the hybrid and composite variants, @mouse07410 ?\r\n\r\nNot sure. If they aren't automatically disabled by modifications defined [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/399#issuecomment-2087051262) - then no. If they are disabled - then yes.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure what the right combination is, but hopefully we can get a reasonable mix in.\r\n\r\nOffhand and IMHO, whatever from the NIST standards that fits TLS well. So far, that's Falcon and ML-DSA.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2095010837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-06T00:11:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8.

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

Brian brought this to s2n-tls's attention and we're currently working on a fix. It looks like we have a hard-coded limit of [64 signature schemes](https://github.com/aws/s2n-tls/blob/main/tls/s2n_tls_parameters.h#L160). There are <40 [ standardized signature schemes with assigned IANA values](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-signaturescheme) as of today, so having a max of 64 probably seemed like a safe assumption at the time.

Do you know for fact that the servers rejecting \r\n> these \"high-count sigalg code point\" handshakes are running OpenSSL?\r\n\r\nNo I don't. I just thought that _if_ the problem is with OpenSSL - then it _may_ eventually get fixed. \r\n\r\n> For sure we know that [fwupd.org is not TLS](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/7207#issuecomment-2095874862).\r\n\r\nFine. I've no clue what stack supports cargo.io. So, if we don't implement what I'm recommending - we'd need to either completely disable at least some OQS algorithms, or wait for indefinite time until _all_ of those TLS stacks get fixed (if at all).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2096838600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-06T20:21:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
