The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2103624058","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#issuecomment-2103624058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650","id":2103624058,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c59YsF6","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-10T00:02:42Z","updated_at":"2024-05-10T00:02:42Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There are several unresolved comments from @baentsch and @SWilson4, will those be addressed before merging?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2103624058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-10T00:02:43Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

This indeed then feels like a regression, particularly considering \r\n\r\n> our [fallback code](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/a5ec23cf19763d36a558b8358345823ae45d57e5/src/common/common.c#L268) is, as far as I can tell, implemented [in exactly the same way](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/openssl-3.3.0/crypto/mem_clr.c) as OPENSSL_cleanse.\r\n\r\nFirst, might it be worth while getting the OpenSSLs team's opinion on your \"non-OpenSSL\" cleansing code?\r\n\r\nSecond, this of course implies we accepted `OPENSSL_cleanse` to be a \"good\" way to do things -- \"just\" with the drawback that OQS will not benefit automatically from further improvements to this as & if the code in `openssl` for this routine changes -- which again speaks for using `OPENSSL_cleanse`.\r\n\r\nThis argument does not sound as strong, though:\r\n\r\n> However, liboqs doesn't default to wrapping OpenSSL code whenever possible. Notably, we don't use OpenSSL's SHA3 implementation by default.\r\n\r\nWell, there's been a reason for that and I hope it's not \"just\" what's [documented](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#oqs_use_openssl) (?):\r\n\r\n> These default choices have been made in order to optimize the default performance of all algorithms. Changing them implies performance penalties.\r\n\r\nThis kind of seems to imply OQS values performance over security. This may be intended but should be clearly documented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2103901702/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-10T05:33:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
