These defines indeed look misplaced there (tagging @bhess fyi) -- but they should (and in CI also do not) trigger a wrong compilation as they're unused as far as I can see... So what compilation errors are you seeing??\r\n\r\nSorry for the misunderstanding. The compilation errors I mentioned are not related to compiling the liboqs library itself, but rather occur when using the ML-DSA algorithm provided by the liboqs library. I was writing a test program that calls all algorithms in liboqs, and I encountered an undefined macro error while trying to call some ML-DSA algorithms (due to modifying code from a template). Specifically, the macro `OQS_SIG_ml_dsa_44_length_signature` is not defined. I checked the header files of liboqs and found these definition errors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2121588020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-21T02:23:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The import of the MAYO code from upstream is automated with copy_from_upstream that also follows this pattern. I agree having a single folder sharing the implementation would be nice to avoid code duplication, but I think it would need quite some refactoring of copy_from_upstream.

Well, it's from the `copy_from_upstream` then we don't need to change.\r\n\r\nWell, the proposal by @bhess makes sense: `liboqs` is way too large/wasteful for practical deployment due to this limitation. It would be a good thing for the OQS team to consider such enhancement if it wanted to move the project to real world deployment (and limit the exposure to flaws in code by simply limiting the amount of code).
