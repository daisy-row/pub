So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

Yes, I am talking about `openssl.cnf` and don't see any reasons to not have such settings as a system default. You can easily override the default settings via passing a custom OpenSSL configuration file, if necessary.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current `openssl.cnf` does **not** include such settings. So, somebody has to add that support to OpenSSL, and then backport it to the stable release(s). \r\n\r\nOn top of that, I'm not crazy about writing down all the algorithms to the tune of `...:rsa_pss_rsae_sha384:rsa_pss_rsae_sha512:RSA+SHA256:RSA+SHA384:RSA+SHA512:ECDSA+SHA224:...` from **all** the providers, that I want supported system-wide. Who's going to do that? @beldmit  you, perhaps? @baentsch maybe you? Or will OpenSSL maintainers just add the keyword `default` that would include _all_ the algorithms from _all_ the enabled providers, and we'll be back at square one?\r\n\r\nWhich is why being able to specify what algorithms each provider would advertise to TLS, seems easier in the short term. \r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n> I was indeed counting wrong the enabled sig algs (I think I was only counting those provided by oqsprovider). When I checked with wireshark, there were many more.\r\n\r\nThat merely means that the actual limit that was exceeded when 60+ algorithms from oqsprovider were added, was larger than 64.

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n[No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n[No] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

(without libjasmin) and a current build (on branch \"ps-jasmin\").... Even cooler of course would be output next to each algorithm name as to which code (level, version, etc.) it's running on the given platform, thus doing away with having to read all caveats as to what is active on a specific platform -- but that's arguably quite some effort.

answering I kindly ask you to make your tone less personal.\r\n\r\n> > Yes, I am talking about `openssl.cnf` and don't see any reasons to not have such settings as a system default. You can easily override the default settings via passing a custom OpenSSL configuration file, if necessary.\r\n> \r\n> However, the current `openssl.cnf` does **not** include such settings. So, somebody has to add that support to OpenSSL, and then backport it to the stable release(s).\r\n\r\n`openssl.cnf` is a configuration file.

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

Before answering I kindly ask you to make your tone less personal.\r\n\r\nYes, of course. My apologies.\r\n\r\n> `openssl.cnf` is a configuration file. It means it can be tuned on each and every system (or left unchanged if it's not necessary). OpenSSL supports and documents this configuration for ages.\r\n\r\nOf course. But first, somebody would have to **add** what you propose to the code that deals with this file, and I suspect it's more work than you're portraying.\r\n\r\nSecond, and more importantly - it will require much more knowledge of the normal user of the \"guts\" of the OpenSSL than IMHO is reasonable to expect.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have no clue what signature (or KEM, or whatever) algorithms OpenSSL supports through _all_ of its providers, and even less so - what algorithms it exports via TLS. \r\n\r\nI don't think it's fair to expect a \"normal\" user - **even if/when this `.cnf` feature gets suported!**  - to list **all** the algorithms he needs \"his\" TLS to support, merely because one provider offers a few extra signature algorithms that \"break the back of the camel\".\r\n\r\n> Perhaps [this section in the USAGE.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/USAGE.md#configuration-parameter) could be expanded a little bit to satisfy @mouse07410 with a warning about that some TLS servers may fail if too many sig algs are offered by the client and how to avoid the problem with a \"safe\" (short enough) selection of signature algorithms as an example (like in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/399#issuecomment-2097815008\r\n\r\n**No**. I don't need this warning - I need to know what **exactly** to put into `openssl.cnf` file so that (a) I can use **all** the algorithms that **all** of the providers offer within something like `pkeyutl`, but (b) exclude **from TLS** some algorithms that I know oqsprovider offers.\r\n\r\nAnd I asked (perhaps, in an impolite way) who is going to provide that text suitable for direct includion into `openssl.cnf`. Surely, you don't expect a user to be knowledgable enough to do that?!\r\n\r\n> That's precisely the quick \"fix\" I also had in mind. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure this \"fix\" will not work for me.
