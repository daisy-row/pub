I tried to load the CA certificate from the haproxy container into Chromium but got the following error: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1443\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-07-09 at 12 51 02 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87200668/125111931-82e96100-e0b4-11eb-9ab4-58343277228b.png\">\r\n\r\nI have verified that I am able to use Curl with this certificate for authentication to access the haproxy, so it is not an issue with the certificate. \r\n\r\nIt appears that I obtain this error when I try to install certificates that use quantum-safe digital signature algorithms. For example, making use of the OQS fork of OpenSSL contained within the Curl container, I run the following command with <SIG_ALGO> = dilithium2, dilithium3, RSA, and falcon512: \r\n\r\ndocker run -v `pwd`:/opt/tmp -it openquantumsafe/curl openssl req -x509 -new -newkey <SIG_ALGO> -keyout /opt/tmp/CA.key -out /opt/tmp/CA.crt -nodes -subj \"/CN=oqstest CA\" -days 365\r\n\r\nThe certificates that used dilithium2, dilithium3, and falcon512 failed to load, but the certificate that used RSA loaded just fine.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated! \r\n\r\nHere is the certificate that I grabbed from
