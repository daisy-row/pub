Arguably needs a decision on https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/2 ; I'm willing to move that issue forward regardless as per the discussion there if the TSC finds this unnecessary to look into/resolve. I personally think this needs resolution as it impacts user decisions as to which OQS sub projects one can depend on (or not).\r\n2) Designate responsibilities for fixing CI. I'd normally say that should be the maintainers (or committers in their absence) of projects designated in \"maintained\" state. Right now this is only documented for [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#current-maintainers-and-committers) and [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md). Both are currently \"CI red\" pointing to a need to improve. For oqs-provider, can I ask @thb-sb whether it's OK for you to be listed as maintainer (and then assume responsibility to look into such things in any future absences of myself)?\r\n3) If there is general acceptance that \"red CI state\" is OK for some projects (?), this is to suggest documenting this decision in the README of each such sub project, maybe together with a public call searching for a maintainer (if not already declared to be EOL).\r\n\r\nIf there is someone else beyond \"designated sub project maintainers\" (@vsoftco @dstebila @thb-sb @baentsch) willing to take ownership for this, please chime in.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/24/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/24/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-07T05:39:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
