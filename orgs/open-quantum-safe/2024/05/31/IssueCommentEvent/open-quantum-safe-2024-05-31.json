So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8.

For example in case of Kyber/ML-KEM one can do a workaround roughly like this in oqs-provider's oqsx_key_op function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if (strcmp(key->tls_name, \"mlkem1024\") == 0) {\r\n                memcpy(key->pubkey, (char *)key->privkey + 1536,\r\n                       key->pubkeylen);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea for this issue is that liboqs could provide a unified interface for recreating the public key from the private key, when it is possible. For example, a function like this could be added to kem.h in liboqs:\r\n\r\n`OQS_API OQS_STATUS OQS_KEM_recreate_pub_from_priv(const OQS_KEM *kem, uint8_t *secret_key, uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAnd in the OQS_KEM structure, for each algorithm a new function could be registered:\r\n\r\n`OQS_STATUS (*recreate)(const uint8_t *secret_key, const uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAdding this functionality could reduce serialized key sizes for some algorithms. This is a rough idea and I just want to ask for the opinions of the folks involved in oqs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2142334042","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802#issuecomment-2142334042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802","id":2142334042,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5_sWxa","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-31T14:21:08Z","updated_at":"2024-05-31T14:21:08Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I know that public key recoverability is a feature shared by many algorithms (I can't think of a modern example that doesn't support it), but I would be hesitant to add a function to the public API unless it's either (1) specified by NIST or another similar body or (2) implemented in almost all scheme APIs. Otherwise, it seems like it would introduce a maintenance overhead for us: we would have to support bespoke functions for each algorithm. I do like the idea of this being a standard feature, but I'm not sure `liboqs` is the place to make it one. I also don't know what the implications for the provider would be. That said, if enough people express interest (and/or are committed to help maintain the code), then I could see the support effort being worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThoughts @dstebila @praveksharma?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2142334042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-31T14:21:09Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
