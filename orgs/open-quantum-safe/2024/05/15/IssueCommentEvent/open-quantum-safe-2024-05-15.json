The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API?

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

security software library should be able to make for its users -- that by and large (should be allowed to) know less than the developers of the library.\r\n\r\nI agree, I don't think this level of

elaborate on them & particularly why they are apparently not used by OpenSSL?\r\n\r\nFor these specific functions, the compilers promise that they will not optimize the call away.  As far as I know, the volatile trick that we use as a backup (and that OpenSSL uses as a default) is just that -- a trick, which we think that compilers will not optimize away, but there's no formal guarantee that compilers won't optimize it away.\r\n\r\n> > I don't understand what the \"rest of\" is referring to here.\r\n> \r\n> I meant all code requiring secure memory clearing in the absence of OpenSSL. If there is none or if the macro is already used throughout the code base, I agree this may be the empty set.\r\n\r\nThis should be the only place that the change is needed in our code base -- the rest of the code in liboqs is meant to be calling `OQS_MEM_cleanse`.  We have some CI tests complaining about bare `free` calls (instead of calls to `OQS_MEM_secure_free` or `OQS_MEM_insecure_free`).  Although I don't think we have any CI tests scanning for memset's, which I speculate would have many false positives.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2111831245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-15T07:58:32Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Please read again: I said OQS \"has not decided to change this\". That is a difference in my understanding of the language -- but it's your native language and not mine, so I may be wrong, so I guess I have to elaborate:\r\n\r\nWe have agreed (and I kept pushing for years) to consider catering for productive use -- but no formal decision has been taken to do this - and particularly for which sub projects and which components and what this entails. Very much to the contrary, OQS still [discourages productive use](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations-and-security) and [there is an open discussion item on this topic](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1).\r\n\r\nYou list all activities that have been taken in the past months -- but I beg you to not forget all activities in this direction in the past years (more automation, more testing, more CI, constant following of up- and downstream patch levels of important software like openssl, etc.).\r\n\r\nStill, as you state, OQS has not taken the step to stand behind the software as an entity like OpenSSL does. And I fully appreciate you have other things to do -- as you appreciate the same being true for me. Hence let me repeat also in this place another thing we agreed in the visioning exercise to need, namely a product manager bringing things into a sensible sequence: What is needed for enabling productive use, get users and their buy-in, create the missing and prioritize the existing issues, get buy-in by the people doing the actual work, putting in place the \"fulfilment processes\", seeing things get done -- just naming a few tasks.\r\n\r\nAgain, please do not take my comment as stating that nothing has been done --as it would de-value the work of many people, including mine-- but that there is no coherent drive, no formal decision and commitment as to what to achieve by when but a hodgepodge of activities (of which supporting Ubuntu 24 is but one).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2112604011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-15T13:51:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2112766040","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#issuecomment-2112766040","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650","id":2112766040,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c597kBY","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-15T14:54:25Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T14:54:25Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hmm -- DCO is not clean.

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry
