It's correct that `liboqs` could call out to the `OPENSSL_cleanse` when built against OpenSSL. I'm not an expert on OpenSSL inner workings, but it looks to me as if `OPENSSL_cleanse` is implemented using the same \"trick\" (to avoid being optimized out) that we currently have in place: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/openssl-3.3.0/crypto/mem_clr.c. On the other hand, `memset_s` is (as I understand it) guaranteed to not be optimized out by a standard-compliant compiler: no tricks required. I agree that we should probably call out to `OPENSSL_cleanse` if `memset_s` is not available, but I'm not sure we should prefer `OPENSSL_cleanse` over `memset_s` if the latter is available.\r\n\r\nFollowing up on this more concretely: could you please rework the logic so that we only use `OPENSSL_cleanse` if neither `memset_s` nor `explicit_bzero` is available (similarly for `SecureZeroMemory` on Windows).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2093753528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-03T20:58:04Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
