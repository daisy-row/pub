Changing `#linuxmacos` to either `#linuxmacOS` or `#linux/macOS` worked for me locally; I chose `#linuxmacOS` because that seems to keep the link intact at the moment. \r\n\r\nCI containers currently use Doxygen 1.9.2, [openquantumsafe/ci-containers#76](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers/pull/76) updates them to use Doxygen 1.10.0.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of

Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of
