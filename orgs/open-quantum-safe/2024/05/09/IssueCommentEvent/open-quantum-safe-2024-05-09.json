If `OPENSSL_cleanse` cannot be the first choice when available then we'd prefer to simply close this PR and have a custom patch in place where we use liboqs.\r\n\r\nI understand that OpenSSL is a ubiquitous, trusted library. However, `liboqs` doesn't default to wrapping OpenSSL code whenever possible. Notably, we don't use OpenSSL's SHA3 implementation by default.\r\n\r\n> For our \"peace of mind\", do you have a pointer documenting this guarantee, @bencemali ? https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/OPENSSL_cleanse.html seems a bit non-committal. What is true is that the `openssl` code does not contain a single case of `memset_s` but a myriad uses of `memset`, including an interesting one [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/f6ce48f5b8ad4d8d748ea87d2490cbed08db9936/include/crypto/md32_common.h#L183-L186) indicating some deliberation as to what function to be sensible in which case. Conceptually, I agree, though, if OQS relies on/is built using `openssl` it would be prudent to use the same --particularly security-- mechanisms `openssl` uses.\r\n\r\nI agree that we could rely on OpenSSL here and wash our hands of the matter, but to me it seems like a regression: our [fallback code](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/a5ec23cf19763d36a558b8358345823ae45d57e5/src/common/common.c#L268) is, as far as I can tell, implemented [in exactly the same way](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/openssl-3.3.0/crypto/mem_clr.c) as `OPENSSL_cleanse`. (I actually wonder if we copied directly from OpenSSL back in the day?) We've made a conscious decision in the past to prefer `memset_s` or `explicit_bzero` over the generic C approach. I was following that precedent above when I suggested to also prefer `memset_s` etc. over `OPENSSL_cleanse`. To break with it requires a stronger rationale than \"prefer OpenSSL whenever possible\" (which we don't do in general).\r\n\r\nI'm open to the idea to defaulting to `OPENSSL_cleanse` whenever possible for simplicity. However, if we prefer `OPENSSL_cleanse` over `memset_s` etc., then we should prefer its approach when we're not building with OpenSSL. Hence, we should also remove the logic to rely on `SecureZeroMemory` / `explicit_bzero` / `memset_s` and simply fall back on the generic `volatile` function pointer code when OpenSSL is not available.\r\n\r\nIMO, what we decide here sets precedent for common (especially OpenSSL-related) code decisions across the project, and we should be able to consistently apply whatever rationale we use for future decisions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2102851376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-09T15:09:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
