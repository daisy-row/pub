The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

Building the current \"latest\" ([e784ed1](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/e784ed12c69f0f6a73e185237d4259d566b5ed97)) works, but requires manual copying post-build from `./oqs-provider/build/lib/` into `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ossl-modules/oqsprovider.so` (do note chmod 644 worked for me, as mine built with 700, likely from my umask). \r\n\r\nI was able to replicate @catharsis71 issue in my original attempts to build release 0.6.0 as the provided release installer chose to install the binary in `/usr/lib/ossl-modules/` instead, which `openssl` didn't appear to look for. I should also note, unless I'm mistaken, the lack of full documentation regarding activiation of OQS with openssl (outside of a demo dockerfile I read) led to much additional initial confusion, along with the lack of a provided binary with `liboqs` (though it did note one could be built). While I won't note much about that, I will note the existing package in Debian's SID branch isn't recognised by the provided 0.6.0 installer in the releases. \r\n\r\nIn the end, the biggest help for me, which someone else may benefit from, was adding/uncommenting the following to `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`:\r\n```\r\n[openssl_init]\r\nproviders = provider_sect\r\n\r\n[provider_sect]\r\ndefault = default_sect\r\noqsprovider = oqsprovider_sect\r\n\r\n[default_sect]\r\nactivate = 1\r\n\r\n[oqsprovider_sect]\r\nactivate = 1\r\n```\r\nFor me, it was specifically `providers = provider_sect` that was not noted elsewhere. Without that line uncommented, the others did nothing for me at all. While I do appologize that this isn't a separate issue, and builds upon a closed issue, this is the best I can provide for those searching for this solution in the future so that this does not become an [XKCD #979](https://xkcd.com/979)\r\n\r\nIn the end, once this is admitted into the Debian repositories fully, such things will no longer be an issue, one could presume. I will note, though, that it was odd to see `liboqs` in Debian's SID repo, but not in testing. For those suffering with this same issue, steering clear of that version would be wise for the time being.\r\n\r\nRegards to all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2136522345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-29T05:08:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry
