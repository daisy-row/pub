Chair's introduction\n+ - The chair thanks members for being patient as we get up and running\n+ - TSC aims to be consensus driven & friendly\n+ - TSC will discuss & make strategic decisions on technical matters. Developer call handlers regular operational matters\n \n ## 2. Approve agenda\n \n+ - Agreed\n+\n ## 3. Appoint minute-taker\n \n+ - Nigel will take this week's notes. Agreed that we would ask at the beginning of each meeting & do in rotation.\n+\n ## 4. Approval of minutes of last meeting\n \n+- Last meeting's notes are open as [PR #14](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/pull/14). Comments/reviewers invited.

Similar to apache incubation approach\n+  - may apply at sub-project or component level\n+  - should map existing oqs subprojects/components to proposal for validation\n+  - clear separation may require feature flags, restructuring of liboqs, additional projects etc\n+  - should delegate to OQS dev meeting to decide/discuss in github issues\n+  - Issue will be opened for followup","path":"meetings/2024-04-10/minutes.md","commit_id":"f9ed9fe4d1e45e4769ec1ee54a4703d41baf654b","original_commit_id":"f9ed9fe4d1e45e4769ec1ee54a4703d41baf654b","user":{"login":"planetf1","id":7292002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTIwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7292002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1","html_url":"https://github.com/planetf1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planetf1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"I think we start with a top level issue at the tsc level since it applies to the whole project (gh org).\r\nI was going to raise an issue, but we have https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1 open already - are you ok we use that.

Chair's introduction\n+ - The chair thanks members for being patient as we get up and running\n+ - TSC aims to be consensus driven & friendly\n+ - TSC will discuss & make strategic decisions on technical matters.

Similar to apache incubation approach\n+  - may apply at sub-project or component level\n+  - should map existing oqs subprojects/components to proposal for validation\n+  - clear separation may require feature flags, restructuring of liboqs, additional projects etc\n+  - should delegate to OQS dev meeting to decide/discuss in github issues\n+  - Issue will be opened for followup\n+- Security\n+  - PQCA [setting up security workgroup](https://github.com/PQCA/TAC/issues/2)\n+  - Hoping to arrange presentation from [OSSF](https://openssf.org/) around [scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) & other best practices.

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n[No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n[No] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n[No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n[No] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the

Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n[No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n[No] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdds implementations of stateful signatures to liboqs for XMSS and LMS. The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
