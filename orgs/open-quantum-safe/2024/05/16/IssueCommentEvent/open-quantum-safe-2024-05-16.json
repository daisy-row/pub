So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

If you find not obvious the entry point to the documentation, please let me know what you think to be a valid starting point to look.\r\n\r\nOh sure! Where do I begin? :-)\r\n\r\nFirst, an obvious place for me to learn about the contents of the config file would be (unsurprisingly!) something like `man openssl-config` or `man config`. OK, present. I proceed down the page and find `[ssl_configuration]`. OK, excellent. It further points me at `[client_tls_config]` and `[server_tls_config]`. Great - but what are the values that I can put there? Here I stumble. Either there should be a list of **all** of the supported keys/parameter-names/whatever, or a reference like \"to see the list of all the keys do `man config-tls`\". And then - for each key needs to be a list of all the possible/legal values, and/or a way to get it (in the correct/required syntax).\r\n\r\nHow's that for the beginning? ;-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2116396032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-16T23:57:59Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
