How many sigalgs do these \" buggy servers\" support OK?\r\n\r\nThese particular two servers (`crates.io:443` and `fwupd.org:443`) that I've been using to test, fail with sig algs between 40 and 43. I can't give an exact number just playing with the `generate.yml`.\r\n\r\n> Can we refer to a (TLS) spec doc that confirms this as truly buggy? If so, let's try to find out those servers' software and raise an issue; completely disabling by default two complete PQ sigalg families seems too strong a limitation for oqsprovider users in response. If oqsprovider in turn violates a spec (sending too many code points?) such a limitation may be called for; but I'd suggest doing a poll first what should be removed from the default set.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is such TLS spec limiting the number of sig algs in the Client hello message, but I will double check. I can also create an issue in fwupd repo, author is very responsive and maybe he can give some hints about why the server fails to respond correctly.\r\n\r\n> Finally, the generate.py code generator must run with idempotence (this property is checked by CI and must be assured before merge).\r\n\r\nI tried to achieve this by using the `generate.sh` script, but I guess I did something wrong.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/2090555375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-02T13:51:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
