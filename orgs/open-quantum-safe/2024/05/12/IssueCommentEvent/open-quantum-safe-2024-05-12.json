Given the missing authorization above, the only way to facilitate that seems to be again investing in bespoke ARM64 CCI code.\r\n\r\nUnpaid volunteers could consider it unfair or unsavory to do such inefficient or \"throw-away work\" to save money to an alliance funded by multi-billion-dollar-profit companies.\r\n\r\nI personally found it OK to do such \"work-around code\" while OQS was a pure research project carried by voluntary contributors, but am unwilling to put in such effort to retain a mirage of a well-funded professional alliance, particularly as I'm personally annoyed seeing LF/PQCA processes forced onto OQS without any immediately visible offsetting benefits such as such suitable CI funding authorizations: I'd really be happy if PQCA were willing to spend a healthy portion of its funding on supporting development and not most on lawyers, marketing and executive travel.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I did complete https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers/pull/84 to lay the foundation for hitting the 0.11.0 goal but for the reasons above will not write further CCI code going forward (beyond the one in the PR above to test the Dockerfile).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2106129888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-12T05:53:15Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
