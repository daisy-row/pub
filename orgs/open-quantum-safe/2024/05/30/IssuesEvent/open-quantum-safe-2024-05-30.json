For example in case of Kyber/ML-KEM one can do a workaround roughly like this in oqs-provider's oqsx_key_op function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if (strcmp(key->tls_name, \"mlkem1024\") == 0) {\r\n                memcpy(key->pubkey, (char *)key->privkey + 1536,\r\n                       key->pubkeylen);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea for this issue is that liboqs could provide a unified interface for recreating the public key from the private key, when it is possible. For example, a function like this could be added to kem.h in liboqs:\r\n\r\n`OQS_API OQS_STATUS OQS_KEM_recreate_pub_from_priv(const OQS_KEM *kem, uint8_t *secret_key, uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAnd in the OQS_KEM structure, for each algorithm a new function could be registered:\r\n\r\n`OQS_STATUS (*recreate)(const uint8_t *secret_key, const uint8_t *public_key);`\r\n\r\nAdding this functionality could reduce serialized key sizes for some algorithms. This is a rough idea and I just want to ask for the opinions of the folks involved in oqs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-30T14:57:25Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
