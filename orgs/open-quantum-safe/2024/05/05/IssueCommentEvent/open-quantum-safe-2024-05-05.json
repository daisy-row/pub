@baentsch I strongly suggest changing the defaults (at least for now) in oqs-templates/generate.yml, and disabling all the signature algorithms except for ML-DSA.\r\n\r\nThat'd be pretty drastic, no? Would you suggest also disabling the hybrid and composite variants, @mouse07410 ? @beldmit: What'd be your position: You seem to have taken to using some of the (now) \"historic\" variants of PQCrystals algs: Would you also be OK if we'd disable them by default? Any objections, @dstebila ? Researchers can always re-enable algs they need, but normal users should not be negatively impacted by shenanigans like these, so I currently tend to support this proposal.
