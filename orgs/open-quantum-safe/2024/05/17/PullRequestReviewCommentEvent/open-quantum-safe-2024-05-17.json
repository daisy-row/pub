Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates Kyber512 and Kyber768 from libjade for `x86_64`  with and without AVX2 optimizations as described in #1466. Once Kyber1024 is made available in libjade the updated `copy_from_upstream.py` script will pull and integrate that code into liboqs as well, requiring only modifications to `copy_from_libjade.yml` and `copy_from_upstream.yml`.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `copy_from_upstream.py` and adds a 'libjade' mode in addition 'copy' and 'verify. This new 'libjade' functions independent of 'copy' mode and copies code for the KEM algorithms specified in `copy_from_libjade.yml` and updates relevant documentation and the library's CBOM. While this additional 'libjade' copy_from_upstream infrastructure can also pull signature algorithms it would likely require minor tweaks to the various templates used by `copy_from_upstream.py`; since libjade doesn't provide full support for any signature algorithm at the moment, those changes are best dealt with a separate PR. \r\n\r\nUPDATE (from comment below):\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I've turned off weekly constant time tests when building with `-DOQS_LIBJADE_BUILD=ON`. Jasmin compiler doesn't include debug information in the x86 assembly it produces so Valgrind is unable to resolve specific function names and locations in source. I've attached output from memcheck for reference: [Kyber768.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045566/Kyber768.txt) [Kyber512.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/files/15045567/Kyber512.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a [closed PR](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/pull/684) in the Jasmin lang repo which added a feature to include DWARF2 information in the generated assembly but this update [ is not included in the latest release](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/blob/dd1fad7b94b6f577e7c6e804b3c5acd839b2660d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L72). Once merged, I can create an issue to track this and update the versions of Jasmin compiler used in CI after that feature is released.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n[No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n[No] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

My rationale was that branches are a \"softer\" tag than a hash: one can update the implementation on a branch such that it becomes non-interoperable with older implementations on the same branch, but this can't be done with a hash. As you point out, however, most commits don't break interoperability. If the MAYO team is committed to implementations on the `nibbling-mayo` branch being interoperable, then I agree that a branch name is preferable.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, maybe we should add interoperability testing...)","created_at":"2024-05-17T13:51:35Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T13:51:35Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1707#discussion_r1605046160","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1707","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1605046160"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1707#discussion_r1605046160"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1707"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1605046160/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":16,"original_line":16,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1603898381,"original_position":16,"position":16,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1707","id":1744064069,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5n9E5F","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1707","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1707.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1707.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1707","number":1707,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Add MAYO signature scheme from NIST onramp","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Adds MAYO signature scheme from the NIST onramp.\r\nThe upstream implementation contains a C and an AVX2 implementation.\r\n\r\n- [x] C code import\r\n- [x] AVX2 code import\r\n- [x] docs update\r\n- [x] constant-time tests\r\n- [x] adds aes128ctr common code\r\n- [x] Merge some changes upstream\r\n- [x] tbc: add cmake switch to compile onramp algorithms: `NIST_SIG_ONRAMP`\r\n- [x] fix a few failing builds\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
