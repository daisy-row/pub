This first minor release of 2024 has a short number of changes: a large improvement of build times for large sites, a new keyboard shortcut to focus the search bar, and sidebar navigation bugfixes for &quot;pretty&quot; URLs (with <code>.html</code> omitted) and the clickable area on Safari. This release has no explicit breaking changes and should be a straightforward upgrade for most (if not all) users.</p>\n<h3>Using Release <code>v0.8.0</code></h3>\n<p>Users who have not pinned the theme version will be <strong>automatically upgraded to <code>v0.8.0</code> the next time they build their site</strong>.</p>\n<p>To use this release explicitly as a remote theme:</p>\n<pre lang=\"yml\"><code>remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.8.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use this version explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your <code>Gemfile</code> and re-run <code>bundle install</code> or <code>bundle update just-the-docs</code>:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ruby\"><code>gem &quot;just-the-docs&quot;, &quot;0.8.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

I'll update the PR per the discussion.\r\n\r\n> It would be good if PR could confirm this: OQS either uses and relies on CI (after getting it right) or it skips/does away with it and merges code based on local run results. The latter probably wouldn't be a step in a direction of a project aiming for \"more productive use\".\r\n\r\nAgree with the former and ok to hold on for green CI.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2117446543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-17T12:02:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So, it's OpenSSL, or liboqs, or oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n@levitte could you please take a look as well? I don't know whether it's the provider's fault, or that of the OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nA little complicated, but here's what I have.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Install Rust toolchain.\r\n2. Install `cargo-update` via `cargo install cargo-update`\r\n3. Have OpenSSL-3.2.1 installed.\r\n4. Install current master of `liboqs`.\r\n5. Clone and install `oqs-provider` (`main` branch).\r\n6. Edit `openssl.cnf` to add `oqs` provider (some add it as `oqsprovider`, for me naming it `oqs` suffices).\r\n7. Try `cargo install-update -l`\r\n8. See error\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```text\r\n$ cargo install-update -l\r\n    Polling registry

The failures are due to permissions issues with the token that we use to trigger the downstream tests. Even if the downstream tests were failing, it would not cause the upstream workflows to \"go red\": the upstream workflow checks the GitHub API response code, which only indicates whether the downstream workflow was triggered successfully, not whether it completed successfully.\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure that's currently failing is mostly my work (https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1507, https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/pull/65, https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/345, https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1654). My understanding is that it broke when the OQS GitHub account was upgraded to \"Enterprise\", which changed what we can and can't do with personal access tokens. @ryjones Please let me know if there's anything I can do (within the permissions I have) to help with getting this to work again. I think I have a pretty good understanding of the moving parts involved with the different workflows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2117713014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-17T14:17:01Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
