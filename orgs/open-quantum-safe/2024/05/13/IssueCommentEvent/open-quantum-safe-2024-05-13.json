Tagging @thb-sb for commenting on this: If you'd follow and interact with the PQCA comms channels (and keep acting as `oqs-provider` maintainer) (?), it may be OK to leave the entry as-is.\r\n\r\nRegarding the forth column, I have to absolutely and adamantly protest the labelling of `oqs-provider` as (LF/PQCA) \"Impact Stage\": That project is NOT receiving financial nor any other support from PQCA (rather the opposite if I compare how OQS operates before and after the LF take-over: Contributions and procedures have surely become more difficult and cumbersome). Most notably, `oqs-provider` (well, I guess myself as the 95% contributor/maintainer of it) is accordingly not willing to \"to cross promote the foundation along with their activities\" as per the demand placed on such project according to the [PQCA project classification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NV-0vNgXWdc81oqT0jv0C-9Funb8dySS06u90ghF-X4/edit) --> please change over to \"Incubation stage\" if you need to apply this classification -- that I personally consider pretty much completely unsuitable to OQS:\r\n\r\nTo justify the latter statement, see these two pretty much contradictory statements:\r\n\r\n>  Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least two independent end users which, in the TACâ€™s judgment, are of adequate quality and scope.\r\n (from [PQCA project classification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NV-0vNgXWdc81oqT0jv0C-9Funb8dySS06u90ghF-X4/edit))\r\n\r\n> WE DO NOT CURRENTLY RECOMMEND RELYING ON THIS LIBRARY IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT OR TO PROTECT ANY SENSITIVE DATA\r\n(from [liboqs usage advice](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations-and-security)).\r\n\r\nand one unresolved issue [#1](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1) to document that labelling `liboqs` \"Impact Stage\" as being completely unjustifiable; according to the above, `liboqs` isn't even \"Growth Stage\". Now, if we were to correct this, not a single OQS sub project would be anywhere else than \"Incubation stage\" -- pretty much leading the whole PQCA classification ad absurdum -- which is why I'd suggest dropping that column outright (also automatically resolving my initial comments regarding the PQCA classification of `oqs-provider` :-).\r\n\r\nHere's btw my practical, non-PQCA-process driven suggestion as to how to handle `oqs-demos` now: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/275\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/comments/2106779304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-13T06:49:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

What is true is that the `openssl` code does not contain a single case of `memset_s` but a myriad uses of `memset`, including an interesting one [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/f6ce48f5b8ad4d8d748ea87d2490cbed08db9936/include/crypto/md32_common.h#L183-L186) indicating some deliberation as to what function to be sensible in which case. Conceptually, I agree, though, if OQS relies on/is built using `openssl` it would be prudent to use the same --particularly security-- mechanisms `openssl` uses.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL API docs about `OPENSSL_cleanse`:\r\n> OPENSSL_cleanse() fills ptr of size len with a string of 0's. Use OPENSSL_cleanse() with care if the memory is a mapping of a file. If the storage controller uses write compression, then it's possible that sensitive tail bytes will survive zeroization because the block of zeros will be compressed. If the storage controller uses wear leveling, then the old sensitive data will not be overwritten; rather, a block of 0's will be written at a new physical location.\r\n\r\nAs this function is in OpenSSL's publicly available API and says that it will fill the buffer with zeros, I'd assume it's a good enough that it works. If it would not, it would be treated as a large security issue within OpenSSL itself.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2107306251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-13T11:17:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

If it would not, it would be treated as a large security issue within OpenSSL itself.\r\n\r\nACK. It's also the reason why OQS apparently also bases its implementation on this as per the statements above.\r\n\r\nSo we're down to deciding the question by @SWilson4 :\r\n\r\n> I'm open to the idea to defaulting to OPENSSL_cleanse whenever possible for simplicity. However, if we prefer OPENSSL_cleanse over memset_s etc., then we should prefer its approach when we're not building with OpenSSL. Hence, we should also remove the logic to rely on SecureZeroMemory / explicit_bzero / memset_s and simply fall back on the generic volatile function pointer code when OpenSSL is not available.\r\n\r\n> IMO, what we decide here sets precedent for common (especially OpenSSL-related) code decisions across the project, and we should be able to consistently apply whatever rationale we use for future decisions.\r\n\r\n--> Do we want to follow the OpenSSL approach throughout? Who's going to change the code \"in the rest of\" `liboqs` accordingly? I'd argue that it should be the OQS team (by way of a new issue) for the non-OpenSSL code path as this PR does it correctly for the case with OpenSSL used. Opinions, @dstebila @SWilson4 ? We could also label such issue as a non-urgent, \"non-product\" issue assuming we decide at some point that OQS must only be used in [productive settings](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1) with [OQS_USE_OPENSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#oqs_use_openssl) set to ON.\r\n\r\nAssuming this is the way we go, I approve.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2107366551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-13T11:48:57Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Looks very useful, though we need to strive for all implementations being constant-time in any case. But I guess this is an additional safety net?\r\n\r\nI don't think this feature is as much an additional safety net as it is a foundation. Most of our efforts on constant-time implementation are focused on this part of the Apple docs:\r\n> While DIT ensures the timing of certain instructions donâ€™t reveal information about the data, you need additional programming practices to prevent other changes to the processorâ€™s microarchitectural state from providing an adversary with signals about secret values. For example, avoid conditional branches and memory access locations based on the value of the secret data.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like DIT ensures that the operations which we assume execute in constant time (e.g., ADD, SUB, XOR) actually do execute in constant time.\r\n\r\nTwo asides:\r\n- We only run constant-time tests on x86_64 at the moment, so even if DIT were switched on for all of our code right now, we couldn't make claims about constant-time behaviour on any ARM platform.\r\n- It looks like a similar feature is available for certain Intel chips: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/data-operand-independent-timing-isa-guidance.html","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/2107628215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-05-13T13:48:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

It actually still strongly [discourages its productive use](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/2#issuecomment-2106779304), i.e., _absence_ from any supply chain, and [has not decided to change this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/issues/1) nor put any plan in place _how_ to do this.\r\n\r\nI do not understand why you say that OQS \"has decided not to change this\" (meaning changing from discouraging production use to supporting production use).  On the contrary, a desire to move OQS to being suitable for production use was stated in the OQS visioning exercises last fall, was a main motivation for moving OQS into LF, and has come up many times in discussions at the PQCA as well.  \r\n\r\nIt is true that we have not yet put in place a plan on how to do this.  But despite the lack of a cohesive plan, I think over the past few months we have seen activity from contributors trying to move the project in this direction from their understanding of what production-ready would require, including: \r\n\r\n- adopting a [scorecard](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1708) of some best practices for open-source project security\r\n- improving software supply chain security from both an [incoming] and [outgoing](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/a5ec23cf19763d36a558b8358345823ae45d57e5/docs/cbom.json#L4) perspective\r\n- adding [formally verified cryptographic implementations](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1745)\r\n- adding stringency around software licensing ([DCO](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1726), [BoringSSL license](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/tsc/pull/17), [CC0 relicensing of libjade upstream](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1745#issuecomment-2085246429))\r\n\r\nThis certainly not everything that needs to be done.  Perhaps you may think some of these are actually a step backwards or sideways at best.  But I cite them here to support the claim that there is activity around moving towards the goal of production use.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the statement that OQS is not recommended for production use remains in the README.  It is possible for us to be working towards our goal without having yet achieved it. I would only want to announce such a switch â€“ and change the README â€“ when we as a group collectively decide we have reached that stage. \r\n\r\nI am struggling to find time to push forward many of the planning activities, including the plan for moving OQS towards production-ready.
