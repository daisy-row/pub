It's worth ensuring >1 owner on each area.\r\n\r\nHaving 2 reviewers is nice, and arguably important in security code as even if one is the owner, something could be missed. the question is whether it slows development down too much, especially in a small repo\r\n\r\nQuite apart from the above, any exceptions to current or future policy could be implemented by having a github action that 'auto-approves' based on a specific encoded policy. So the basic rule would be tight, and then this allows some consessions.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1963998154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-26T12:09:10Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

For some algorithms, integration is done manually, for some automated (`copy_from_upstream`, `copy_from_xkcp`). While care has been taken to document the resultant \"zoo of licenses\", more locations than one exist for this, e.g., \"spdx-identifiers\" in all source code files, a \"summary spdx-identifier\" in the  [algorithm documentation sheets](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/docs/algorithms), separate \"LICENSE\" files (originating with but possibly [not in line with the upstream code bases](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1512#discussion_r1271456474)) and a central [LICENSE](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) file  valid only for the `liboqs` API, pointing to the sub-folder LICENSE files.\r\n\r\nFor research purposes, where publication (of code and results) is norm and goal, it arguably is sufficient that code _has_ a license -- which `liboqs` already provides. For integration into commercial products (including OS distributions) this arguably is insufficient (see e.g., #1437).\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to be able to create binaries suitable for inclusion into commercial software distros (?), e.g., RedHat, all code in `liboqs` arguably needs to have unambiguous license statements. Given the large corpus of \"external\" code (`liboqs` already counts 225 \"LICENSE\" files -- even before the inclusion of LMS/XMSS) this needs to be fully automated, such as to allow creation of binaries that can be used in commercial distributions (e.g., MIT, Apache2) and those that can be used in truly open, e.g., research settings (e.g., CC0, GPL).\r\n\r\nThis issue is to propose work to review and automate all license handling within `liboqs` -- with the ultimate goal to allow `liboqs` (and its subprojects and users) [to select at build time only those algorithms/code bases using specific licenses](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1437#issuecomment-1549014050), e.g., \"commercialization friendly\" (e.g., MIT, Apache) or \"fully open source\" (e.g., GPL) or \"research friendly\" (arguably any).\r\n\r\nThoughts about the need (and timeline and willingness to support this work) for this particularly welcome from anyone possibly having a commercial use case in mind, e.g., @vsoftco @christianpaquin @bhess @crockeea @beldmit @thb-sb  (already thumbs up or down would be helpful to gauge interest in this boring \"legalese\" issue :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1514/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1964026177","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1514#issuecomment-1964026177","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1514","id":1964026177,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c51EKlB","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-26T12:23:55Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T12:23:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> there may be additional tweaks needed in build/docs for oqsprovider\r\n\r\nBy all means, create PRs to add those as you(r company) see(s) fit. fwiw, `oqsprovider` historically does have a stronger focus on the \"STD\" algs (surely in CCI) but it would be good to document/qualify this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1964026177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-26T12:23:56Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
