So, although not perfect, you could minimize the number of server/client spin ups to COUNT(algs)/44 ~= 2.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm going to focus on removing pytest from liboqs. This will probably turn into converting the `pytest` scripts into vanilla python scripts and having `ctest` call them. I feel like this is more portable than writing bash scripts, but also far less painful then converting them to `c` binaries that need to be compiled, and that exec the test binaries with the right arguments...\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1950274101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-17T18:14:59Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
