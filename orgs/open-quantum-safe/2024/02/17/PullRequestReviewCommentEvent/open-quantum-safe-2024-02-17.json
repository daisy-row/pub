from using ninja and custom cmake target `run_test` to using cmake & ctest.\r\n\r\nUpon reading issue #1494 I got inspired.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove the need for ninja, and make tests platform agnostic.\r\n\r\nThe new build process will work as follows:\r\n```\r\ncmake -B build\r\ncmake --build build --parallel\r\nctest --test-dir build/tests --output-on-failure\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, cmake does not have the nice pytest --ignore feature. So to ensure\r\ntest_kat_all doesn't run by default, the `OQS_ENABLE_LONG_TESTS` variableis introduced.\r\nIf you would like to run the long tests (currently only `test_kat_all`) you would do the\r\nfollowing:\r\n```\r\ncmake -B build -DOQS_ENABLE_LONG_TESTS=on\r\ncmake --build build --parallel\r\nctest --test-dir build/tests --output-on-failure\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2024-02-17T06:40:34Z","updated_at":"2024-02-17T07:01:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94bc63657ebadaf17b025e1ec43201445b510bfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1700/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1700/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1700/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/c45b9dfb7fa040d1c356b60b4bc35a288442042e","head":{"label":"open-quantum-safe:pr1700","ref":"pr1700","sha":"c45b9dfb7fa040d1c356b60b4bc35a288442042e","user":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65514205,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTUxNDIwNQ==","name":"liboqs","full_name":"open-quantum-safe/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs","description":"C
