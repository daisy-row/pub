This feedback covers documentation and LMS code. I'll leave comments on XMSS and tests in a second review.\r\n\r\nA general comment: for LMS, there are a couple of `#define` options that enable different code to be built (e.g., `DO_FLOATING_POINT`). It looks like we're not exposing them in configuration anywhere, which means (I assume) that `liboqs` will always be built and installed with the \"default\" values, unless the user edits source code. It also means that the non-default options are never tested. I see the value in keeping these options around from an experimental point of view, but we should probably add (yet another!) disclaimer that they are not tested, even for correctness.","commit_id":"3f6aeac235672add0edc9ab406f38429702fa307","submitted_at":"2024-02-23T00:19:55Z","state":"commented","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#pullrequestreview-1885728969","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1650","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#pullrequestreview-1885728969"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1650"}}},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1650","id":1663975754,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5jLkFK","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650","number":1650,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Add Stateful Signature (XMSS and LMS)","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdds implementations of stateful signatures to liboqs for XMSS and LMS. The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

This feedback covers documentation and LMS code. I'll leave comments on XMSS and tests in a second review.\r\n\r\nA general comment: for LMS, there are a couple of `#define` options that enable different code to be built (e.g., `DO_FLOATING_POINT`). It looks like we're not exposing them in configuration anywhere, which means (I assume) that `liboqs` will always be built and installed with the \"default\" values, unless the user edits source code. It also means that the non-default options are never tested. I see the value in keeping these options around from an experimental point of view, but we should probably add (yet another!) disclaimer that they are not tested, even for correctness.","commit_id":"3f6aeac235672add0edc9ab406f38429702fa307","submitted_at":"2024-02-23T00:19:55Z","state":"commented","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#pullrequestreview-1885728969","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1650","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650#pullrequestreview-1885728969"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1650"}}},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1650","id":1663975754,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5jLkFK","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1650.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1650","number":1650,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Add Stateful Signature (XMSS and LMS)","user":{"login":"ashman-p","id":23340773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQwNzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23340773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p","html_url":"https://github.com/ashman-p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashman-p/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdds implementations of stateful signatures to liboqs for XMSS and LMS. The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature. This is separated because of the need to manage the stateful of secret keys.\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

The feature include new OQS APIs to generate key-pairs, signature generation, verification, and secret key state-management. Actual secret key storage is left up to the application.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes an enhancement to OQS SHA2 API to allow handling updates with arbitrary length buffers.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ No ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ Yes ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\nOQS provider support is a separate and forthcoming feature.
