If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nResolves #1539\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree.

The `test_sha3` test ran fine when I removed all instances of `n_out` so I'm curious if this is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\nIf `n_out` is indeed unnecessary, then perhaps we can also remove the wrapper structs `intrn_shake128_inc_ctx` and `intrn_shake256_inc_ctx` and instead point `state->ctx` directly to an instance of `EVP_MD_CTX`.\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?

Since we have to revise the workflows anyway to enable stateful sigs, this seems like an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone: move as many as possible to GH and enable stateful sigs en route.\r\n\r\nGo for it!
