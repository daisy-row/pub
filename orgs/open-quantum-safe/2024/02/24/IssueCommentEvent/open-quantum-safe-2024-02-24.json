Also tagging @bhess @dstebila for input.\r\n\r\nIf so, shall we (also follow the IETF hackathon's lead and) eliminate Kyber entirely from `oqsprovider`? Or shall we assign either algorithm different OIDs? Which ones? The ones used by the hackathon team IMO cannot be extended as they are in a range controlled by a commercial entity (prefix \"1.3.6.1.4.1.\").\r\n\r\nMay I propose @bhess takes on responsibility for managing the Kyber/Dilithium/ML-KEM/ML-DSA ID range and resolve this particular conundrum?\r\n\r\nGiven we have introduced the capability of encoding KEMs solely for interop testing (and to resolve https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/194), what about adding a statement along the lines \"This feature is experimental until a solid management of KEM OIDs is established. Use at your own risk.\" to the documentation of [OQS_KEM_ENCODERS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#oqs_kem_encoders) and remove it from CI until we have properly resolved this issue?
