But I appreciate you offering and yes, I will take that help. If you set up the tests, I will work with you to flush out any errors. I will begin with the errors Micheal mentioned. I suspect that they are not actual failures but more of a presentation. For example the stateful tests were first written with the expectation that both XMSS and LMS were present. But if say LMS was disabled calls to create LMS variants would fail (and should fail) in fact all 28 variants :).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1936244200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-09T16:39:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
