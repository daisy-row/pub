Complicating matters, this feature has been introduced 2 releases ago, so there is not a single \"past\" as per the comment above. Further, persistent KEMs are not an active feature by default, so not resolving this now is not considered harmful.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this discussion, #351 has been created to track the underlying issue and clarification has been added to the documentation in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/348/commits/29e9e808128b33e1a873a6c23ca3b20d79020078 to properly set user expectations. Contributions to resolve for good very welcome, preferably before a next

Complicating matters, this feature has been introduced 2 releases ago, so there is not a single \"past\" as per the comment above. Further, persistent KEMs are not an active feature by default, so not resolving this now is not considered harmful.\r\n> \r\n> To resolve this discussion, #351 has been created to track the underlying issue and clarification has been added to the documentation in [29e9e80](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/29e9e808128b33e1a873a6c23ca3b20d79020078) to properly set user expectations.

Otherwise, the OIDs will change when this PR lands, and then change back (!?) when the second PR lands?

That seems like it will cause even more chaos.\r\n> \r\n> The OIDs have changed already. They're random, after all -- since October 2023.\r\n\r\nDid they change in October 2023, or were they introduced in October 2023?  I'm looking at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/5515b4b4d084b2f06a7a935b9c6e796ae070de15#diff-ef6f384f213c1efa6cdc7974fec75a672ce414650acb8ec1f0abdd5984076595R167 which is dated October 5 2023 and it looks to me like this when OIDs for e.g. FrodoKEM were first added, and then they've been stable since them.","created_at":"2024-02-22T17:21:34Z","updated_at":"2024-02-22T17:21:34Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/348#discussion_r1499604649","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/348","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/1499604649"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/348#discussion_r1499604649"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/348"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/1499604649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":191,"original_line":191,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1494354859,"original_position":65,"position":65,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/348","id":1709682908,"node_id":"PR_kwDOE_A9l85l57Dc","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/348","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/348.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/348.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/348","number":348,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"first
