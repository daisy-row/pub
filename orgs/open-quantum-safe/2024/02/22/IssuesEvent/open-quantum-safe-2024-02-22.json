Due to the absence of standard documents specifying them, most of the IDs chosen are randomly allocated, many manually, many automatically.\r\n\r\nAs persistence of PQC signature algorithms is a default feature of `oqsprovider`, OIDs for signature algorithms are manually curated and updated as OID updates are required, e.g., due to algorithm updates.\r\n\r\nAs persistence of PQC KEM algorithms is a non-default feature of `oqsprovider`, OIDs for KEM algorithms are mostly automatically generated and therefore not stable across releases.\r\n\r\nThis issue is to propose changing this with at least the following improvements:\r\n- Document the origin for each (O)ID\r\n- Change automatic OID allocation for KEM algorithms to manually curated allocation, paving the way for making [OQS_KEM_ENCODERS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#oqs_kem_encoders) a default feature","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-22T07:17:57Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
