I'm absolutely baffled by what I see: The httpd server in your setup properly responds to queries fielded by an equivalent `oqsprovider` build/client, e.g.,\r\n\r\n    docker run --network epiphany_default -it openquantumsafe/curl sh -c \"openssl s_client --connect epiphany-server-1:4433 -groups kyber768\"\r\n\r\nAlso, the epiphany (browser) image in your composition properly operates `openssl` and `oqsprovider` when logging in to it via `docker exec`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl list -providers -verbose\r\nProviders:\r\n  default\r\n    name: OpenSSL Default Provider\r\n    version: 3.3.0\r\n    status: active\r\n    build info: 3.3.0-dev\r\n    gettable provider parameters:\r\n      name: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      version: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      buildinfo: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      status: integer (arbitrary size)\r\n  oqsprovider\r\n    name: OpenSSL OQS Provider\r\n    version: 0.5.4-dev\r\n    status: active\r\n    build info: OQS Provider v.0.5.4-dev (510fea6) based on liboqs v.0.10.0-dev\r\n    gettable provider parameters:\r\n      name: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      version: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      buildinfo: pointer to a UTF8 encoded string (arbitrary size)\r\n      status: integer (arbitrary size)\r\nopenssl s_client -connect test.openquantumsafe.org:6036 -groups kyber768\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Just\" when putting the two things together, i.e., using the known-good local `openssl` code against the known-good `oqs-httpd`, things fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl s_client -connect epiphany-server-1:4433 -groups kyber768\r\nConnecting to 172.18.0.3\r\nCONNECTED(00000003)\r\n40F761B92B7F0000:error:0A000410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:ssl/tls alert handshake failure:ssl/record/rec_layer_s3.c:907:SSL alert number 40\r\n---\r\nno peer certificate available\r\n---\r\nNo client certificate CA names sent\r\n---\r\nSSL handshake has read 7 bytes and written 1425 bytes\r\nVerification: OK\r\n---\r\nNew, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)\r\nThis TLS version forbids renegotiation.\r\nCompression: NONE\r\nExpansion: NONE\r\nNo ALPN negotiated\r\nEarly data was not sent\r\nVerify return code: 0 (ok)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`oqs-epiphany` then not working is a logical consequence.
