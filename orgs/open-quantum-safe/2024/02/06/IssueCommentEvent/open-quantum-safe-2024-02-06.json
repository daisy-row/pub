A single (properly configured :-/) run of the tests (when integrating a new code base, say) suffices to unearth such problems. In the pursuit to speed up the PR CI cycle, it clearly was my fault to suggest running tests weekly _without_ instituting a rigorous procedure around checking and resolving issues they discover. The new \"automated downstream\" merge trigger (when someone checks one of the \"new code\" boxes) could be the place where these tests could live in the future. Or we agree that a \"red\" weekly CI mark in the dashboard needs to be addressed before the next weekly call.\r\n\r\n> from a maintenance point of view I'd rather find out about them before we get to the point of cutting a release candidate.\r\n\r\nI completely second that -- and that rationale was AFAIK the reason why we instituted them. But again, I think we do not have sufficient clarity what we want to achieve by passing those tests (or which algorithms _must_ pass them). Only that decision will inform us about the rigour (or not; or maybe different for different algorithms) we need to pursue them.\r\n\r\nMy rationale for keeping these tests \"green\" was to increase the level of trust people can have in the library to the degree that they can deploy it productively and every carve-out hurt me (with that goal in mind). But without that goal in mind we can (should?) focus our work effort on other things, e.g., bring XMSS \"over the finish line\". By way of example: If \"product readiness\" were a (stated and pursued) goal, I'd fight integrating XMSS+LMS tooth and nail (until they pass all --to be defined-- essential tests, such as constant-time, no memory leaks, standardized KATs/interop, downstream utility/\"integrate-ability\", proper licensing, etc... whatever we deem (document!) as prerequisite).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1928867567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-06T06:30:42Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
