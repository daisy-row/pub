If not, do we care?\r\n- I will look into this and report back later this week/early next week.\r\n\r\nDo we want to keep pytest as the underlying test framework and just have cmake sit on top of it?\r\n- In the meeting @dstebila showed support for keeping pytest for now. At the very least we can do the change incrementally. @baentsch's comments seem to prefer removing pytest at the same time as switching to cmake. I am open to either, but I think converting from pytest is going to be a decently large task on its own, so it might be worth doing in a separate PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1956024175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2024-02-21T07:12:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
