It will function when somebody with the appropriate permissions (presumably @dstebila?) adds an `oqsbot` (classic) personal access token with `repo` and `workflow` permissions as an Actions secret with the variable name `OQSBOT_GITHUB_ACTIONS`. We already have one of these in use in CircleCI.\r\n\r\n### Previous description (prior to 2023-02-01)\r\n\r\nCurrently, our [release process](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Release-process) requires that the `oqs-provider` release tests be run manually for `liboqs` release candidate branches. This PR automates this process in CI, setting them to run automatically on pull requests for any branch whose name has the prefix `dev-`. This prefix is up for discussion; I used `dev-` because it's what we used for the latest release, and because using `rc-` would cause issues if we ever get a PR from somebody named, say, Ray Charles.\r\n\r\nThe full release tests complete in about 50 minutes in CI—see [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581)—which I think is not too bad. Note that although the linked workflow says it uses a \"minimal set\" of algorithm combinations, it actually does run all combinations; I just didn't update the workflow documentation before pushing. The full set of tests should run again on this PR as a proof of concept; I'll revert to running them only on release candidate PRs once that workflow completes.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow is based on the [`release-test.sh` script in the `oqs-provider` repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh). I didn't call the script directly since some aspects (checking out a new temporary branch then resetting back to main, cloning liboqs, etc) were either unnecessary in the CI setting or better handled by a built-in action.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- What prefix do we want to use for release candidates?\r\n- Is there a way to ensure that this script stays in sync with `oqs-provider` release testing requirements?\r\n- For @baentsch specifically: what version of OpenSSL should we be checking against here? I defaulted to `master` as the [release test documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh#L33) said to use the \"latest\" version.\r\n- Do we want to also automate some of the other release testing? We could, for example, also run the full constant time tests as part of this workflow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1647 (assuming that `oqs-provider` is the only downstream for which we want automated release testing).\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

It will function when somebody with the appropriate permissions (presumably @dstebila?) adds an `oqsbot` (classic) personal access token with `repo` and `workflow` permissions as an Actions secret with the variable name `OQSBOT_GITHUB_ACTIONS`. We already have one of these in use in CircleCI.\r\n\r\n### Previous description (prior to 2023-02-01)\r\n\r\nCurrently, our [release process](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Release-process) requires that the `oqs-provider` release tests be run manually for `liboqs` release candidate branches. This PR automates this process in CI, setting them to run automatically on pull requests for any branch whose name has the prefix `dev-`. This prefix is up for discussion; I used `dev-` because it's what we used for the latest release, and because using `rc-` would cause issues if we ever get a PR from somebody named, say, Ray Charles.\r\n\r\nThe full release tests complete in about 50 minutes in CI—see [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581)—which I think is not too bad. Note that although the linked workflow says it uses a \"minimal set\" of algorithm combinations, it actually does run all combinations; I just didn't update the workflow documentation before pushing. The full set of tests should run again on this PR as a proof of concept; I'll revert to running them only on release candidate PRs once that workflow completes.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow is based on the [`release-test.sh` script in the `oqs-provider` repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh). I didn't call the script directly since some aspects (checking out a new temporary branch then resetting back to main, cloning liboqs, etc) were either unnecessary in the CI setting or better handled by a built-in action.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- What prefix do we want to use for release candidates?\r\n- Is there a way to ensure that this script stays in sync with `oqs-provider` release testing requirements?\r\n- For @baentsch specifically: what version of OpenSSL should we be checking against here? I defaulted to `master` as the [release test documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh#L33) said to use the \"latest\" version.\r\n- Do we want to also automate some of the other release testing? We could, for example, also run the full constant time tests as part of this workflow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1647 (assuming that `oqs-provider` is the only downstream for which we want automated release testing).\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

It will function when somebody with the appropriate permissions (presumably @dstebila?) adds an `oqsbot` (classic) personal access token with `repo` and `workflow` permissions as an Actions secret with the variable name `OQSBOT_GITHUB_ACTIONS`. We already have one of these in use in CircleCI.\r\n\r\n### Previous description (prior to 2023-02-01)\r\n\r\nCurrently, our [release process](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Release-process) requires that the `oqs-provider` release tests be run manually for `liboqs` release candidate branches. This PR automates this process in CI, setting them to run automatically on pull requests for any branch whose name has the prefix `dev-`. This prefix is up for discussion; I used `dev-` because it's what we used for the latest release, and because using `rc-` would cause issues if we ever get a PR from somebody named, say, Ray Charles.\r\n\r\nThe full release tests complete in about 50 minutes in CI—see [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581)—which I think is not too bad. Note that although the linked workflow says it uses a \"minimal set\" of algorithm combinations, it actually does run all combinations; I just didn't update the workflow documentation before pushing. The full set of tests should run again on this PR as a proof of concept; I'll revert to running them only on release candidate PRs once that workflow completes.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow is based on the [`release-test.sh` script in the `oqs-provider` repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh). I didn't call the script directly since some aspects (checking out a new temporary branch then resetting back to main, cloning liboqs, etc) were either unnecessary in the CI setting or better handled by a built-in action.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- What prefix do we want to use for release candidates?\r\n- Is there a way to ensure that this script stays in sync with `oqs-provider` release testing requirements?\r\n- For @baentsch specifically: what version of OpenSSL should we be checking against here? I defaulted to `master` as the [release test documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh#L33) said to use the \"latest\" version.\r\n- Do we want to also automate some of the other release testing? We could, for example, also run the full constant time tests as part of this workflow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1647 (assuming that `oqs-provider` is the only downstream for which we want automated release testing).\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

It will function when somebody with the appropriate permissions (presumably @dstebila?) adds an `oqsbot` (classic) personal access token with `repo` and `workflow` permissions as an Actions secret with the variable name `OQSBOT_GITHUB_ACTIONS`. We already have one of these in use in CircleCI.\r\n\r\n### Previous description (prior to 2023-02-01)\r\n\r\nCurrently, our [release process](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Release-process) requires that the `oqs-provider` release tests be run manually for `liboqs` release candidate branches. This PR automates this process in CI, setting them to run automatically on pull requests for any branch whose name has the prefix `dev-`. This prefix is up for discussion; I used `dev-` because it's what we used for the latest release, and because using `rc-` would cause issues if we ever get a PR from somebody named, say, Ray Charles.\r\n\r\nThe full release tests complete in about 50 minutes in CI—see [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/7426702581)—which I think is not too bad. Note that although the linked workflow says it uses a \"minimal set\" of algorithm combinations, it actually does run all combinations; I just didn't update the workflow documentation before pushing. The full set of tests should run again on this PR as a proof of concept; I'll revert to running them only on release candidate PRs once that workflow completes.\r\n\r\nThe CI workflow is based on the [`release-test.sh` script in the `oqs-provider` repo](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh). I didn't call the script directly since some aspects (checking out a new temporary branch then resetting back to main, cloning liboqs, etc) were either unnecessary in the CI setting or better handled by a built-in action.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- What prefix do we want to use for release candidates?\r\n- Is there a way to ensure that this script stays in sync with `oqs-provider` release testing requirements?\r\n- For @baentsch specifically: what version of OpenSSL should we be checking against here? I defaulted to `master` as the [release test documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/eb80076d1683121db35fabf8c1b0c6f9125c1b6d/scripts/release-test.sh#L33) said to use the \"latest\" version.\r\n- Do we want to also automate some of the other release testing? We could, for example, also run the full constant time tests as part of this workflow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1647 (assuming that `oqs-provider` is the only downstream for which we want automated release testing).\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [no] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.
