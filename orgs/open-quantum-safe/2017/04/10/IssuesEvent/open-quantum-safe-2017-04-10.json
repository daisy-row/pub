If \"true\" key length is actually 8n+r bits (0<r<8) then kex_rlwe_vscrypto returns key_len = n+1, causing last byte to lose entropy.\r\n\r\nChanging the API so key_len is in bits, not bytes, would address this and is probably more mathematically correct than sticking with bytes.  Downside would be coding complexity."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-04-10T13:36:18Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
