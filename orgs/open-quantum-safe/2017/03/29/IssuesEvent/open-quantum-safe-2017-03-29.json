The library I am writing is targeting application developers, so multi-threading and SIMD parallelization are high priority, is one version better suited for this than the others? \r\nI think the most important criteria though is, do you feel one version is more secure than the others, this includes upwardly flexible parameter sets, and the application of attack vector counter-measures like constant time functions.\r\nI looked at Supersingular Isogeny a few years ago, but could only find the one 'cython' implementation on git.. it's an interesting idea, and could be made quite fast, but I wonder if it has had enough study. The same goes for the McBits version of McEliece.. but again, I would be really interested to know what you think about this..\r\nAnyways, thanks so much for all this great work, it is certain to make my job a lot easier.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-03-29T17:35:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
