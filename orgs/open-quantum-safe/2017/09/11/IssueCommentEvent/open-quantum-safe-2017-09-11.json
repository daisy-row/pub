I was wondering if you have any idea how we can add this Android build to our continuous integration system.  We use Travis for Linux and macOS build testing and AppVeyor for Windows build testing.  Do you know if there's anything similar for Android?  Or maybe Travis Linux builds can cross compile for Android?  Something like that will help us check that we don't break the Android builds going forward."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-09-11T13:46:10Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
