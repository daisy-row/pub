Not sure about the `scan_build` part, haven't tested that yet. Also I included the uncompressed/compressed key sizes, even though it appears the kex is configured to be uncompressed by default. I vaguely described the underlying problem in the top level description as just 'the hidden isogeny' problem, I can pin that to the SSDDH problem as below if that's better."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/328197696","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/165#issuecomment-328197696","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/165","id":328197696,"user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T19:49:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T19:49:46Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Obsoleted by #166."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-09-08T19:49:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
