This is pull request enables two somewhat separate features (ARMv8 (cross)compilation and Android compilation). Both parts are a bit tricky to test properly in this case. The ARM part requires ARM environment to run, which can be [problematic](https://www.tomaz.me/2013/12/02/running-travis-ci-tests-on-arm.html) due absence of proper support. As for the Android part, it looks like Travis [requires gradle](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android/) and there is no apparent support for NDK.\r\n\r\nHowever both can be (and were) cross-compiled from a normal Linux box. Android may require NDK toolchain though. The only real difference that I came across when compiling C for Android is the lack of `stderr` and the [mandatory](https://source.android.com/security/enhancements/enhancements50) `-pie` flag to run the executable."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-09-12T10:32:55Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
