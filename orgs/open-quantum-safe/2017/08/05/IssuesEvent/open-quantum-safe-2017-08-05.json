If it compiles on C, it is only because the compiler is substituting the correct integer type, but this will not compile on C++, due to the more rigid standard. \r\nTo the fix this, you could rename those integers to int64_t.. but IMO, I think the right choice would be to complete the conversion process and thoroughly evaluate the changes.\r\n\r\nHere are the places I've identified the problem:\r\nfft.c, butterflies, out array\r\nfft_tr.c butterflies_tr, tmp array\r\npk_gen.c, pk_gen, mask variable\r\nencrypt.c, gen_e, mask variable\r\nbm.c, into_vec, out array\r\nThere may be others.."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-08-05T15:16:02Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
