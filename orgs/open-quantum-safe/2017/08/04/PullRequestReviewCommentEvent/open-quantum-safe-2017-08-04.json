I vaguely described the underlying problem in the top level description as just 'the hidden isogeny' problem, I can pin that to the SSDDH problem as below if that's better.","created_at":"2017-08-02T22:21:45Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T16:43:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6a4b0d1f400b02b27b3a5a44b6aba5ce6ca1d52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/165/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/165/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/165/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/8594cc269c6710884340aaf3d8a6859d0af8a0ae","head":{"label":"dconnolly:master","ref":"master","sha":"8594cc269c6710884340aaf3d8a6859d0af8a0ae","user":{"login":"dconnolly","id":552961,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/552961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly","html_url":"https://github.com/dconnolly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98935930,"name":"liboqs","full_name":"dconnolly/liboqs","owner":{"login":"dconnolly","id":552961,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/552961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly","html_url":"https://github.com/dconnolly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dconnolly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/dconnolly/liboqs","description":"C
