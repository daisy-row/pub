NOT READY TO MERGE ==**\n\nI wanted to start the discussion on the signature API. \n\nI used a structure very similar to the key exchange structure (kex.h). Could you have a look and make comments / edits (users with write access to this directory can modify this branch) on this structure?\n\nOne of the doubt I have is about `priv` and (the absence of) `priv_len`. I am not sure why `priv` has a different type `void *` than the public key in the kex; do we want the same here?\n\nOther thing about the message and hashing: do we want to make anything explicit on that matter?\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/275168239","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/14#issuecomment-275168239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/14","id":275168239,"user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-25T17:07:48Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T17:07:48Z","body":"See #92 proposal, following this thread discussion."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-01-25T17:07:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
