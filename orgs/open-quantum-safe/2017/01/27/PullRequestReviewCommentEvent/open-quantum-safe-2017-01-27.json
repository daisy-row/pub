No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes). One option is to not expose the state through the API, and simply return an error if the key is now unusable (this could be sufficient for comparison testing, but insecure for a real-application). The alternative would be to expose the state through the API (and that might still not be sufficient enough for security, to deal with state reset attacks).

discussion on pull request #14, here is a suggested API for signing. No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes). One option is to not expose the state through the API, and simply return an error if the key is now unusable (this could be sufficient for comparison testing, but insecure for a real-application). The alternative would be to expose the state through the API (and that might still not be sufficient enough for security, to deal with state reset attacks).

discussion on pull request #14, here is a suggested API for signing. No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes). One option is to not expose the state through the API, and simply return an error if the key is now unusable (this could be sufficient for comparison testing, but insecure for a real-application). The alternative would be to expose the state through the API (and that might still not be sufficient enough for security, to deal with state reset attacks).

discussion on pull request #14, here is a suggested API for signing. No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes). One option is to not expose the state through the API, and simply return an error if the key is now unusable (this could be sufficient for comparison testing, but insecure for a real-application). The alternative would be to expose the state through the API (and that might still not be sufficient enough for security, to deal with state reset attacks).

No scheme has been integrated yet.

discussion on pull request #14, here is a suggested API for signing. No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes).

discussion on pull request #14, here is a suggested API for signing. No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes). One option is to not expose the state through the API, and simply return an error if the key is now unusable (this could be sufficient for comparison testing, but insecure for a real-application). The alternative would be to expose the state through the API (and that might still not be sufficient enough for security, to deal with state reset attacks).

No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes).

No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes).

No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes).

No scheme has been integrated yet. If the team agrees, I'll start work on integrating one.\r\n\r\nOne open question is what to do with stateful schemes, such as XMSS, that do not adhere with a conventional signature API. Since the main goal of OQS is to compare PQ schemes, it is useful to include them (like XMSS in pull request #79) even if there are limitations on usage of the private key. (NIST for example [suggests](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/faq.html#Q2) to define specific use cases for stateful schemes). One option is to not expose the state through the API, and simply return an error if the key is now unusable (this could be sufficient for comparison testing, but insecure for a real-application). The alternative would be to expose the state through the API (and that might still not be sufficient enough for security, to deal with state reset attacks).
