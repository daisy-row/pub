I would like to have the OQS_KEX or OQS_SIGN data structure for a few reasons: still maintaining a generic high level API that is parameterized by the scheme, and to include metadata such as key sizes and security levels\r\n4. okay\r\n5. For ephemeral/passive key exchange where the private key is only used once, I think void * is okay, but for schemes with long-term keys, each scheme would have to provide an explicit serialization/deserialization that the caller has to make use of; so I think for signatures byte strings is simpler (and matches Supercop / NIST)\r\n6. It's not clear to me how to do transforms based on determinism for KEMs if you don't pass an RNG down.  But then again it's also not clear to me how to do such transforms even if you do pass an RNG down.  Thoughts?\r\n7. Probably would simplify the API.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try writing a signature API and post it as a comment here shortly.
