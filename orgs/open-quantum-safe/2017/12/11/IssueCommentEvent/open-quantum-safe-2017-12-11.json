But subsequent applications that compile against the resulting liboqs build won't know which algorithms were actually enabled/disabled in the version of liboqs they're compiling against.  So we need some way to pass this information down.  The way that comes to mind is to have a .h file created during ./configure that `#define`s each of the compile-time options, and then this header file is included in all the other liboqs headers and part of the `make install` command.  This way when other applications compile against the installed version of liboqs, they will also get the `#define` options passed through and can make choices based on that, if they need to."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/350834038","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/168#issuecomment-350834038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/168","id":350834038,"user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-11T19:38:30Z","updated_at":"2017-12-11T19:38:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Fixed by #177 "}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-12-11T19:38:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
