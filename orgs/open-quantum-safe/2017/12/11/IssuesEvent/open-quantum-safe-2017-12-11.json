But subsequent applications that compile against the resulting liboqs build won't know which algorithms were actually enabled/disabled in the version of liboqs they're compiling against.  So we need some way to pass this information down.  The way that comes to mind is to have a .h file created during ./configure that `#define`s each of the compile-time options, and then this header file is included in all the other liboqs headers and part of the `make install` command.  This way when other applications compile against the installed version of liboqs, they will also get the `#define` options passed through and can make choices based on that, if they need to."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-12-11T19:38:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
