An incrementing domain code is used to initialize Keccak's state to unique values inside the inner loop, and a different domain code should yield a completely different output from SHAKE, even with the same seed, but in this case, the coefficient arrays produced are all identical. \r\nI have traced this to the (sha3.c) OQS_SHA3_cshake128_simple_absorb function. That function adds the domain code to the first state member, transforms the state, and then calls the keccak_absorb function, passing in the modified state.
