An incrementing domain code is used to initialize Keccak's state to unique values inside the inner loop, and a different domain code should yield a completely different output from SHAKE, even with the same seed, but in this case, the coefficient arrays produced are all identical. \r\nI have traced this to the (sha3.c) OQS_SHA3_cshake128_simple_absorb function. That function adds the domain code to the first state member, transforms the state, and then calls the keccak_absorb function, passing in the modified state. At the top of keccak_absorb, the state is *zeroed*, in effect, erasing the permuted domain code from the state, and hence the identical output is generated.\r\nCan someone confirm this?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/353807348","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/200#issuecomment-353807348","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/200","id":353807348,"user":{"login":"Steppenwolfe65","id":8007343,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8007343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65","html_url":"https://github.com/Steppenwolfe65","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Steppenwolfe65/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-24T23:28:26Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T23:28:26Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Douglas,\r\nI got time to finish this today, and uploaded the files to my project:\r\nhttps://github.com/Steppenwolfe65/CEX/tree/master/Test/Misc\r\nI included tests, and documented their origin (sha3_test.h), so it should be easy to verify.\r\nI'll send an email to the address on your Frodo paper with a summary tomorrow.\r\nHope this helps.. and happy holidays!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohn Underhill"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-12-24T23:28:26Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
