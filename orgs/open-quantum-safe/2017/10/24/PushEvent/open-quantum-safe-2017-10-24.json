Applications may be using multiple runtime libraries or memory managers, calling the wrong free will result in memory corruption or segfault\r\n\r\n* Add missing newline at end of file.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commits/8bc8cd9db8bdb6635f454b33820a7c812e47efae"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-10-24T13:31:37Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
