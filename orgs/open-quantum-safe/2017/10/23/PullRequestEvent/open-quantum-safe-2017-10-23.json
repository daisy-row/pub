The reason for doing so is to not have dependencies on files being placed at specific locations on disk.\r\n\r\nGiven the kex interface in use, there is currently no convenient way to define custom sets of parameters. I initially wrote code that places the parameters adjacent in memory to the named_parameters string, and had the algorithm pick them up from there. I had to scrap that idea for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Does not work well with the tests because it requires preparing the parameters before using the algorithm.\r\n2. Code becomes unintuitive and obfuscated.\r\n\r\nI think the current solution offers a good balance between usability and features.","created_at":"2017-10-18T11:58:41Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T13:46:14Z","closed_at":"2017-10-23T13:46:14Z","merged_at":"2017-10-23T13:46:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc522d612154d1ad8b7176594cc3f30251558b76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/766b274d041c217311948cb0419da7aabd57a157","head":{"label":"mvd-ows:sidh_iqc_ref_parameters","ref":"sidh_iqc_ref_parameters","sha":"766b274d041c217311948cb0419da7aabd57a157","user":{"login":"mvd-ows","id":31660200,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31660200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows","html_url":"https://github.com/mvd-ows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":107128122,"name":"liboqs","full_name":"mvd-ows/liboqs","owner":{"login":"mvd-ows","id":31660200,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31660200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows","html_url":"https://github.com/mvd-ows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvd-ows/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/mvd-ows/liboqs","description":"C
