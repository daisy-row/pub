Works now, both on Windows and Linux on my system. Travis fails because of prettyprint (I tried to clean up one file by removing a \\r, but that might have broken the prettyprint rules). Prettyprint doesn't work on my machine, can someone run it (@vsoftco , @dstebila ?) That should take care of the problem, and we'll finally be able to merge that branch.
