It aborts if NULL was passed in place of one of the parameters. This has the effect that it masks coding errors. For example, passing NULL instead of &alice_msg results in an early return, whereas for all other algorithms, it results in a crash. I strongly recommend implementing a consistent behavior for all algorithms.`"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-10-25T13:24:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
