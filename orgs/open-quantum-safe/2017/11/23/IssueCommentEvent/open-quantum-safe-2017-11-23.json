The file would expose objects to Node so that it can be required. The wrapper effectively turns the library into a node module that can then be packaged up and published to NPM (Node Package Manager). The dream would be to install the package quickly via NPM then require it in my project files. A package manager (NPM) would also allow one to easily keep the library up to date.\r\n\r\nMy use case\r\nI'm working on prototyping a reliable UDP protocol. I would like to introduce a layer of quantum resistant encryption using SIDH.
