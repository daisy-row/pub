The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/760947741","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-760947741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":760947741,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MDk0Nzc0MQ==","user":{"login":"xykro","id":9986471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODY0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9986471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro","html_url":"https://github.com/xykro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-15T13:40:15Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T13:40:15Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@christianpaquin and @baentsch \r\n\r\nWith some delay I applied some last improvements and did some final testing.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts and I hope we will be able to complete this pull-request soon.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-15T13:40:15Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

You shouldn't have to touch the \"meths\" at all.\r\n\r\nTo implement the signature provider you need to:\r\n\r\n1) Implement a provider side key manager. As an example you might look at providers/implementations/keymgmt/dsa_kmgmt.c\r\n\r\n2) Write the signature implementation itself. For example see providers/implementations/signature/dsa.c\r\n\r\n3) Reference the key manager and signature implementations from your main provider query function\r\n\r\nAn optional extra is to implement encoders/decoders for your algorithm so that you can actually serialise/deserialise your keys to/from files. But you don't need to do that to do some simple tests.\r\n\r\nOnce created, and with your provider loaded into your libctx it should just \"work\" with EVP signature code. First you'll have to generate a key (error handling omitted for brevity):\r\n\r\n````\r\nEVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name(NULL, \"MY-SIGNATURE-ALG\", NULL);\r\nEVP_PKEY *key = NULL;\r\n\r\n/* Depending on how your alg works you might need to generate a params EVP_PKEY first.\r\n * Otherwise go straight to generating the key */\r\nEVP_PKEY_keygen_init(ctx);\r\n/* Call EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params() here if necessary for your alg */\r\nEVP_PKEY_gen(ctx, &key);\r\n````\r\nThen to actually test the signature itself:\r\n\r\n````\r\nEVP_MD *md = EVP_MD_fetch(NULL, \"SHA256\", NULL);\r\nEVP_MD_CTX *mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_new();\r\nunsigned char *sig;\r\n\r\nEVP_DigestSignInit(mdctx, NULL, md, NULL, pkey);\r\nEVP_DigestSignUpdate(mdctx, msg, sizeof(msg));\r\n\r\n/* Determine the size of the signature. */\r\nEVP_DigestSignFinal(mdctx, NULL, &siglen))\r\n\r\nsig = OPENSSL_malloc(siglen);\r\nEVP_DigestSignFinal(mdctx, sig, &siglen);\r\n````","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-15T14:19:57Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/761065466","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-761065466","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":761065466,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MTA2NTQ2Ng==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-15T17:08:37Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T17:08:37Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'll take a look next week.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-15T17:08:37Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
