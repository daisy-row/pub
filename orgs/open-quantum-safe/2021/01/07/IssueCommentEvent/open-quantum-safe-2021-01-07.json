signatures is definitely going to be complex to implement. I did pluggable kex because the changes I needed to make to enable that to work weren't that much more than the changes I needed to do to make libssl provider aware for kex. The kem support that @romen implemented was simply an extension of the existing kex work.\r\n\r\nSignatures OTOH are going to require more extensive changes. I haven't looked too closely at it yet, but one issue that springs to mind is that, until now, we've always had fixed \"slots\" for different certificate types. So you get one slot for an RSA cert, one for an ECDSA cert, one for DSA, and so on. With pluggable signatures we're going to have to support a varying number of algorithms and so we'll have to dynamically allocate the slots in some way.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that springs to mind is that we're going to have to support X509 certs with arbitrary signature algs. I haven't looked at what would be required to support that. It might be straightforward....but it might not.\r\n\r\nWith all that said I don't want to put you off having a go. I'd be delighted if you could get it working and I'd be more than happy to offer what advice and assistance I can given my limited bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the timescale, that is unclear. At the moment there seems like a long list of things we need to fix before beta1 is ready, so we certainly have some time. But we haven't got a definitive target date at the moment. Strictly speaking beta1 is the feature freeze point, but for a feature as significant as this I think @romen is right, there would have to at least be an OTC decision to approve it. Partly it might depend on how invasive and extensive the changes end up being.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-07T15:16:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
