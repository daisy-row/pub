Can the provider rely on those symbols to be present or not?\r\n\r\nNo, these are internal symbols that your provider should not use. These are internal helper functions that we wrote for own providers - with the expectation that 3rd party provider authors would do something different.\r\n\r\nThis is the implementation of `ossl_prov_is_running` for most of our internal providers:\r\n\r\n````\r\n/* By default, our providers are always in a happy state */\r\nint ossl_prov_is_running(void)\r\n{\r\n    return 1;\r\n}\r\n````\r\nSo, its really not very useful. We need it because our fips provider has a more complicated implementation. But I doubt this will be the case for you so you can probably just remove it and replace any callers with \"1\".\r\n\r\nThe purpose of `ossl_prov_ctx_free` is to free our own provider ctx object. But I would expect you would want to define your own ctx so that you put oqs relevant data in it.\r\n\r\nSimilarly `PROV_LIBCTX_OF` is simply a macro for getting the libctx out of our own ctx. But if you have your own ctx, then you'll need a different way of getting the libctx out (assuming you need to use a libctx?)\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-07T16:55:21Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
