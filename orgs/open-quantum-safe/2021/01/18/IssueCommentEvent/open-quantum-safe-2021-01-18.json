It really helped getting me going with the latest push; so let me change the question above to: Did I understand the operations of the (not exceptionally deeply documented) function `a2d_ASN1_OBJECT` correctly?

Thus, I'm now re-requesting a review as CI passes also on signatures.\r\nOn a related note, was I right replacing `EVP_DigestSignInit` with `EVP_DigestSignInit_ex` as only the latter allowed me to utilize a `libctx`?

If I understand the logic correctly it creates the *content* bytes of the DER encoding of the specified OID, but it does not include the tag/length bytes - so what you get as a result is not valid DER by itself.\r\n\r\nI think probably what you need to do is call `OBJ_txt2obj` to create an `ASN1_OBJECT` from the numerical OID. From there you can call `i2d_ASN1_OBJECT` to create valid DER for the OID.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-18T11:02:08Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Bugs remaining in the oqs(sig) provider will surely surface that way :-) Objections to this plan?\r\n\r\nTo the extent that my opinion matters on what gets merged in this repo - fine by me :-)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I think this bug is going to be a bit of a killer for you:\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13893\r\n\r\nUntil that bug is fixed you're not going to be able to use X509 certs that contain externally provided algorithm public keys.\r\n\r\nOnce we can do X509 with external algs I'm thinking that the next problem will be the fixed table of cert types that libssl holds:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/47b784a41b729d5df9ad47c99355db2f2026a709/ssl/ssl_local.h#L2018\r\n\r\nWe currently store in that structure the certificate/chain and associated key for each algorithm type that we support. And the algorithms types are a fixed list. I think this should be where you start. We need that to be able to cope with algorithm types that we don't know up front. It's unclear how much you can do on this without the X509 bug being fixed - but perhaps you can start.\r\n\r\nOnce that works the next problem will be to introduce pluggable sigalgs in the same manner that we have pluggable groups.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the above I think you are going to need to write encoders/decoders in your provider for the various algs. At least for DER anyway because you need to encode and decode public keys for libssl.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-18T17:54:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
