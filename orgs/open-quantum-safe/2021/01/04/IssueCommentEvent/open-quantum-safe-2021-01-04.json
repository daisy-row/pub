could argue to close the issue as we have started the migration :-) Question(s) open to discussion (creation of other issues or maintaining this issue for documentation/decision-making purposes?):\r\n\r\nHow do we want to continue after this start? Below's a first list of options. @christianpaquin ,  @xvzcf , @dstebila Please edit/amend/comment as you see fit.\r\n\r\n1) Add CI\r\n2) Add OQS-test suite\r\n3) ensure OpenSSL `make test` passes 100%\r\n4) Add hybrid KEMs\r\n5) Add full OQS-signature support (incl. hybrids)\r\n6) Add OQS-CMS support\r\n7) Add OQS-speed/s_test profiling support\r\n\r\nInitial thoughts:\r\n1-3 would not deliver value before we decide to support this branch for interested external parties: Let's decide (when to do) that. Initial idea: The moment OpenSSL3 goes Beta. Looking at [this](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/milestone/17), this might take some time still.\r\n4-7 would not deliver incremental value over what already is provided in the OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1 branch.\r\nDoing 5 with an EVP integration as in OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1 would be work lost as and when the issue documented [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/10512) gets implemented upstream. We could offer to work on this upstream with higher priority than replicating our OQS-EVP code in OQS-OpenSSL1.1.1: This would enhance OpenSSL _and_ make an OQS provider uptake upstream easier. Also, if [OSSL-issue 10512](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/10512) is implemented perfectly, CMS integration may be \"automatically\" available.\r\nDoing 7 would also probably preferably be done with upstream feature requests/\"direct PRs\" as groups now _are_ a first-order, EC-independent concept and one could make a case that they should be made selectable via `-groups` in all openssl programs (speed, s_time for profiling).","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-04T10:41:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
