you very much! This also again confirms the utility of the effort @mattcaswell put into guiding us to \"dis-entangle\" internal APIs.\r\n\r\nWe'll probably put this into its own open-quantum-safe repo and maintain it there at latest when OpenSSL3 goes beta to immediately \"PQC-enable\" OSSL3: OK for you?\r\n\r\nAt first glance, I fail to see the KEM tests, though: Was there a reason to not bring those over or do I overlook them?\r\n\r\nFinal question: What'd be your recommendation as to where to maintain OQS provider code for \"the long run\"?

Final question: What'd be your recommendation as to where to maintain OQS provider code for \"the long run\"? Background: We'd eventually be interested in achieving all the same OQS-OSSL functionality in 3.0 that the 1.1.1 fork has (incl. certs, CMS, etc.). The present state of things means that we probably best maintain the provider in an OSSL3 fork until pluggable signatures are available and we can make do with a fully external provider and don't need \"upstream patches\" any more. The latter clearly would be our preference.\r\n\r\nIf it was me, I would separate the provider from your 3.0 fork. The provider is useful standalone with standard OpenSSL 3.0. It gives you full integration to the \"EVP\" level crypto - so users could start using OQS algorithms in their code immediately just by dropping in the OQS provider without having to have a \"custom\" OpenSSL. Separate to that are the additional changes you need to OpenSSL to support full integration for things like TLS/CMS/whatever. Users that want that can download your fork. By having the two things separate it gives people a higher degree of flexibility depending on what they want to achieve.\r\n\r\n> How soon do you see the latter (full provider support for keys, X509, signatures, ...) come to pass?\r\n\r\nI personally would like to see TLS pluggable signature support in 3.1. I expect and hope for X509 support in 3.0. I think the main thing preventing it at the moment is https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13893. Not sure what you mean by \"keys\" and \"signatures\" support...those things should be possible now. TLS *pluggable* signature support is of course missing, but you can do libcrypto signatures now. Not sure what is required for CMS.\r\n\r\n> a guesstimate as to the timeline you'd (all together) be looking at for this? \r\n\r\n3.0 won't be out until later this year. No timeline has yet been discussed for 3.1, but I'd be surprised if it was quicker than a year after the 3.0 release so we're talking 2022 at the earliest.\r\n\r\n> In turn, would you'd consider work on our side to replicate in OSSL3 core what we did in 1.1.1 to be futile and quickly superfluous as full provider-enablement/\"legacy-disablement\" is your goal probably?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if any work you did could be used as the basis for adding the missing features upstream once we start accepting patches for 3.1, e.g. rather than just hacking in OQS TLS signature support - actually adding pluggable signatures which could be used as the basis for that feature in mainline OpenSSL.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-29T11:35:34Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Suggested rephrase:\r\n\r\n> The code must build at least on Linux (x86_64). Optimizations and other operating systems supported may be supported and must be suitably registered for each algorithm in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/.CMake/alg_support.cmake\r\n\r\nAlso this statement isn't quite correct for all algorithms: \r\n\r\n> Source code must be formatted in accordance with our formatting requirements (make prettyprint).\r\n\r\nIssues: a) We're not using `make` any more and b) this only applies to OQS core code, not the actual algorithms. So I suggest to introduce a new section \"Common code\" and move the above statement there changed as follows:\r\n\r\n> Source code contributed to OQS core code must be formatted in accordance with our formatting requirements. Non-OQS core code is any code not originally created in this repository but only imported manually or automatically, such as specific quantum-safe algorithms. Adherence to our formatting requirements is successfully tested by executing `./tests/run_astyle.sh` in the liboqs project root folder without \"Formatting\" statements returned. Passing this test is a prerequisite for successful CI.\r\n\r\nThe `Automated inclusion` section needs to be re-written once #883 is landed.\r\n\r\nRegarding [Testing](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Contributing-guide#testing):\r\n\r\nWhat about changing that heading to \"Continuous Integration Testing (CI)\" ?\r\n\r\nIssues: We are not testing Centos 7 any more, so we need to drop the statement. \r\n\r\nRegarding Ubuntu: Would it be time to upgrade to a more recent LTS than 18.04? Canonical main stream is 20.04. -> I'd suggest to agree a time frame for this update.\r\n\r\nDo we further want to posit\r\n\r\n> Normal pull requests (PRs) must have all CI tests pass. Non-standard PRs must explain the reasons for breaking CI as well as a plan how to get CI to work again.\r\n\r\nIf so, we further face the issue that only core team members can actually trigger full CI. So should the further demand passing all CI tests locally be explicitly stated? Not really sure what to recommend here, so leaving a recommendation away at this time.\r\n\r\nNext steps: Please comment below with changes, additions, etc. so we can agree in a next meeting how to close out this issue.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/769799298","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/884#issuecomment-769799298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/884","id":769799298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2OTc5OTI5OA==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-29T13:17:47Z","updated_at":"2021-01-29T13:17:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> We could revert back to unauthenticated Docker pulls in our CircleCI config for now\r\n\r\nI'd also think this eases cooperation: See #885 ","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-29T13:17:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
