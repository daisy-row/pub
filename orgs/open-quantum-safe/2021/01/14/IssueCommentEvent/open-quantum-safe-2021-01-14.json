Any ideas how to resolve this would be very welcome.\r\n\r\nI think an upstream fix for that constant would be appropriate for 3.0. The situation is different compared to 1.1.1. In, 1.1.1 there was no possibility of plugging in new groups etc from external sources. Therefore the only way you could go over the SERVER_HELLO_MAX_LENGTH limit was if you had already modified the OpenSSL source. This is no longer the case with 3.0, so it seems reasonable to change it.
