Extract new provider code from openssl entirely, i.e., create stand-alone OQS-Provider build environment\r\n\r\nThis should conceptually be doable, speed up build time and make code updates completely independent from upstream changes (unless APIs change there, of course). This would speak for an entirely separate OQS subproject instead of a branch. Drawback: Effort required to create a cross-platform build environment. Alternative: Straight integration of this code into `liboqs` (which already has such build env but no OSSL3 dependency... hmmm... Discussion solicited). In any case, arguably only really necessary when OSSL3 goes beta.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-05T10:02:13Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
