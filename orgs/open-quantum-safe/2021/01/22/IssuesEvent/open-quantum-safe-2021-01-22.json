The META.yml definitions are obviously a pqclean-\"invention\", but they are a nice way to make an easy path for integrating also other implementations/libraries. Perhaps it could be renamed to copy_from_upstream.\r\n> \r\n> I'm slightly updating the script with the following features. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense here:\r\n>\r\n>- Adding support to checkout the upstream code from a git-repository: copy_from_pqclean.yml will contain a section \"upstreams\" with several git-repos (pqclean, pqcrystals-kyber, pqcrystals-dilithium, etc...), and the git-commit hash that will be used. This will replace the PQCLEAN_DIR env. variable. Instead, the git repo location will be used (this can be a github-url, a local path on the filesystem, etc.).\r\n> - Adding a \"verify\" switch to the script: The goal is to be able to prove that the code used in liboqs origins from an upstream location with a specific commit. This will basically repeat the copy_from_pqclean process, hash of the code that is checked out, and compare it with the code in the liboqs src-directory. For someone using liboqs it should be useful to be able to reproduce and verify from where the crypto code origins.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-22T11:02:42Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
