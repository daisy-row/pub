The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/765218760","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-765218760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":765218760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTIxODc2MA==","user":{"login":"xykro","id":9986471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODY0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9986471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro","html_url":"https://github.com/xykro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-22T08:05:55Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T08:05:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Thanks very much for your perseverance and the good use case integrating \"classic\" and OQS sshd, @xykro !

The META.yml definitions are obviously a pqclean-\"invention\", but they are a nice way to make an easy path for integrating also other implementations/libraries. Perhaps it could be renamed to copy_from_upstream.\r\n> \r\n> I'm slightly updating the script with the following features. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense here:\r\n>\r\n>- Adding support to checkout the upstream code from a git-repository: copy_from_pqclean.yml will contain a section \"upstreams\" with several git-repos (pqclean, pqcrystals-kyber, pqcrystals-dilithium, etc...), and the git-commit hash that will be used. This will replace the PQCLEAN_DIR env. variable. Instead, the git repo location will be used (this can be a github-url, a local path on the filesystem, etc.).\r\n> - Adding a \"verify\" switch to the script: The goal is to be able to prove that the code used in liboqs origins from an upstream location with a specific commit. This will basically repeat the copy_from_pqclean process, hash of the code that is checked out, and compare it with the code in the liboqs src-directory. For someone using liboqs it should be useful to be able to reproduce and verify from where the crypto code origins.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/765729081","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/880#issuecomment-765729081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/880","id":765729081,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NTcyOTA4MQ==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-22T22:47:26Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T22:47:26Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"That all sounds good to me!","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-22T22:47:26Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
