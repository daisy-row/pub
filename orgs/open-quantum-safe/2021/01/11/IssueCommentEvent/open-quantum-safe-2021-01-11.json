Internal APIs are subject to change at any time (including in a patch release) - so you could suddenly find everything breaks (potentially even in deployed instances) if OpenSSL gets upgraded in a new patch release if you have internal dependencies.\r\n\r\nTests are slightly different, since they don't end up in the actual provider code - so if you want to reuse the OpenSSL test framework then fair enough. That said though, I would think that you would ultimately want to build your provider and tests in its own build tree and not be part of the OpenSSL one. If you get to the point where you're not modifying any OpenSSL internals any more then you no longer have a need to have a fork of OpenSSL, and really you only want the code in your repo that is directly relevant to your provider. There's no reason why you couldn't lift all the bits out of OpenSSL that you need for that (including the underlying build and test frameworks).","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-11T15:32:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
