Unfortunately, this is a bit too short to let us meaningfully comment on it (compiler version, options, ?). Also, this code exists identically in the upstream repos it actually originates with/is maintained in, e.g., [in PQCrystals](\r\nhttps://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium/blob/497a98bc7efe48cb0d18fd20d6d9a4b5629406ef/ref/packing.c#L264), so I'm afraid we can't really do something about it other than say that we know this code builds on Windows (see AppVeyor testing [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dstebila/liboqs)).","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-08T09:03:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
