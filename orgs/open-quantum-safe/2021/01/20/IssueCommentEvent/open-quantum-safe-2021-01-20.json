And forgive me in case I'm using the Github-PR-Tool in unusual ways, it's my first time doing a PR and sometimes I am a bit confused between commenting/responding/reviewing and so on. So many features! 😄 \r\n\r\n---\r\n> I followed the instructions (from the [quick start]( docker exec -ti oqs-openssh-client ssh oqs@oqs-openssh-server) and [connect](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/openssh/README.md#connect-from-container-to-container-via-oqs-ssh) readme sections) trying to create the client and server images, but the client exits after creating keys. I got it to work last time, but not this time.\r\n\r\n@christianpaquin I agree, there was something messed up. Clarified this one.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> I tend to agree: `README.md` still contains quite a bit of usage information, e.g., the whole \"### Connect from container to container via OQS-SSH\" section: In my eyes, a person only doing `docker run` (say, off docker hub) should understand anything s/he can do by reading `USAGE.md` (from quick start to advanced usage). `README.md` should (only) explain all build options (and point to `USAGE.md` as/where appropriate).\r\n\r\n@baentsch I think now I am at a point where I can clearly see each files purpose. Thus far it was kind of foggy in my perception. Will address this and planning on commiting later today.\r\n\r\n---\r\n> From the contents perspective, I'd kind of prefer a stronger algorithm than dilithium2-hybrid as default.\r\n\r\n@baentsch In the [OQS-OpenSSH-Repository, tag OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2020-08](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/tree/OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2020-08#digital-signature) (which I am using in this docker build), it is stated that, and I quote \"only L1 signature and all Rainbow variants are enabled by default\". Enabling more algorithms is a more complicated process (which I will mention in my updated README) that requieres adjusting some files after pulling the repo and is so far not supported in the build process. And I don't want to use Rainbows because they are slow as heck and annoying when trying and using the image. Additionally I reckon, that if only those algorithms are enabled by default there may be some reason behind it?\r\n\r\n---\r\n> @xykro please tag me when this is done.\r\n\r\n@baentsch Will do.\r\n\r\n---\r\nOne more thing: @baentsch would you quickly review the `.circleci/config.yml` file and check if my configuration for openssh looks like it should in order to work properly? Let me know if anything needs improvement there.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-20T12:58:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
