For backward compatibility reasons, we need to consider the possibility that there are legacy implementations in the wild, and that involves both NIDs and structures like EVP_PKEY_METHOD.  We may get them because of engines, or because the calling application has its own built-in implementations!\r\n\r\nNIDs as we know them aren't really that good to keep around, because of their \"constant\" nature.  I have it on good authority that the constants were never meant to become public, but they became so, and we got the role of OID/NID registry.  We don't want to continue with that role, so we're avoiding the cementing of NIDs in the libcrypto\\<-\\>provider interface, which is the boundary where we care very much what's assumed and what's being passed back and forth.\r\nWe do have a numeric identifier for the diverse provider algorithms in libcrypto, but that's a separate set of numbers, and completely dynamic.  You can find out the numeric identifier for an algorithm with functions like `EVP_SIGNATURE_number()`, but there's no point attributing any more importance than a temporary number in that process...  the same algorithm may have a different number in the next run.\r\nSince we've chosen a name based approach for the new public EVP functionality and for key types, my expectation is that when all the legacy stuff is gone, we won't really need NIDs any more.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we decided is that we don't want to see any ASN1 code inside the FIPS module.\r\n\r\nApart from that, what happens within the confines of a provider is a different matter, and as you can see, we play pretty hard and fast in places, and that's ok, as long as we're careful what passes over the libcrypto\\<-\\>provider interface.\r\n\r\nThe problem isn't so much about `OBJ_obj2nid`, all we'd need is to switch to `OBJ_obj2txt` and pass the result to something like `EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name()`...  something like that.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-27T11:52:38Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

It's based on  Moritz Neikes [TIMECOP](https://post-apocalyptic-crypto.org/timecop/index.html).\r\n\r\nThe idea behind TIMECOP is that if you tell Valgrind that secret data resides in uninitialized memory, then Valgrind will tell you when your program branches on secret data.\r\n\r\nSUPERCOP's implementation of TIMECOP introduced \"classify\" and \"declassify\" terminology for the operation of telling Valgrind that memory is secret or non-secret. I've replicated that terminology by defining two macros in oqs.h:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#define OQS_TIMECOP_CLASSIFY(addr, len)  VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED(addr, len)\r\n#define OQS_TIMECOP_DECLASSIFY(addr, len)  VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED(addr, len)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery secret can ultimately be traced back to a call to randombytes, so we can tell Valgrind that secrets reside in uninitialized memory by defining our own randombytes, e.g.\r\n\r\n```c\r\nvoid TEST_KEM_randombytes(uint8_t *random_array, size_t bytes_to_read) {\r\n  OQS_randombytes_system(random_array, bytes_to_read);\r\n  OQS_TIMECOP_CLASSIFY(random_array, bytes_to_read);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand making it the default\r\n```c\r\n  OQS_randombytes_custom_algorithm(&TEST_KEM_randombytes);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've done this in test_kem.c and test_sig.c. If you run the new test_kem or test_sig outside of Valgrind there's no change. But in Valgrind you'll see something like this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ valgrind ./tests/test_kem sntrup761\r\n[...]\r\n== Thread 2:\r\n== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)\r\n==    at 0x2B4EBF: PQCLEAN_SNTRUP761_CLEAN_crypto_kem_keypair (kem.c:145)\r\n==    by 0x10BCE8: kem_test_correctness (test_kem.c:94)\r\n==    by 0x10C58B: test_wrapper (test_kem.c:177)\r\n==    by 0x4CDAFA2: start_thread (pthread_create.c:486)\r\n==    by 0x4DED4CE: clone (clone.S:95) \r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n(I've compiled with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug to get the line numbers were secret branching occurs.)\r\n\r\nOf course, some non-secret data is derived from calls to randombytes, and examining pqclean_sntrup761_clean/kem.c we see that line 145 is part of a rejection sampling loop and the branch is not secret. We can remove the false positive by calling OQS_TIMECOP_DECLASSIFY on the offending memory.\r\n\r\nThere's a different example of declassifying memory in Kyber512 in the first commit linked to this PR.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nNone of changes to oqs.h, test_kem.c, or test_sig.c introduce a dependency on Valgrind. Users can still compile test_kem and test_sig and run them outside of Valgrind. All we need are some header files that the Valgrind project provides, for this purpose, under a BSD license. I've added those to src/common/valgrind.\r\n\r\n**TODO:**\r\n- [x] Configure CMake to include the local valgrind/memcheck.h and valgrind/valgrind.h.\r\n- [x] Add a compilation flag to completely remove calls to VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED. Compiling the schemes with \"-DNVALGRIND\" will do the trick. Alternatively we can change the definitions of OQS_TIMECOP_(DE)CLASSIFY in oqs.h with an ifdef.\r\n- [ ] Flag false positives with OQS_TIMECOP_DECLASSIFY.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/768514030","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/881#issuecomment-768514030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/881","id":768514030,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODUxNDAzMA==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-27T19:15:30Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T19:15:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks John!
