Thanks.\r\n\r\n> I think this should be where you start. \r\n\r\nYup - rings a bell. Current change in our 1.1.1 fork:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/b61ce603bb0e85e343ef5072ce5c52a4273f159f/ssl/ssl_local.h#L499\r\n\r\nGiven there are lots of \"explicit\" index-references to the `pkeys` array, would you agree it would be best to retain it but allocate it dynamically after loading the providers (and querying their algs)? Most notably, I do not see GOST in the providers but in the SSL core logic, so we probably can't easily remove the \"current\" (or classic) `pkeys` slots and make it completely provider-driven. Or should that be our goal: Making OpenSSL run possibly even without RSA and GOST? Reminds me of the [default groups list discussion (optionally retaining the classic ones at the top of the list)](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13831). `SSL_PKEY_NUM` of course would become a variable. So overall I'd say this area can be dealt with. \r\n\r\nWhat currently makes me wonder more is how to deal with the function lists (`pmeth` and `ameth`): I see that the functions have their equivalents in the providers (hence also the need to implement encode/decode) but I don't see already how to automate this for any provider (shall we allocate the data structures `EVP_PKEY_ASN1_METHOD` and `EVP_PKEY_METHOD` also dynamically, populating them with provider calls?). In our 1.1.1 fork we completely \"mirrored\" those functions for all OQS key types: see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/b61ce603bb0e85e343ef5072ce5c52a4273f159f/crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c#L1318 and https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/b61ce603bb0e85e343ef5072ce5c52a4273f159f/crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c#L1732 including giving them their own NIDs to not break anything in that space in the rest of OpenSSL. I started digging into things like `ossl_algorithm_do_all` and method construction but I'm only at the very start....","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-19T06:05:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

We have a fully working OQS KEM provider for OSSL3 and a fork for 1.1.1 doing certs and pretty much everything else, so I guess we're fine for now.\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to reciprocate your support so far (and maybe in the future) by trying to resolve existing issues you have -- in the process picking up knowledge to make progress on pluggable signatures eventually. So if there's a list of items to resolve before v3beta1, please let me know, maybe pointing to ones most suitable for someone not entirely certain about all nuts and bolts in OpenSSL (if such issues were around).","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-19T11:12:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The list of issues that we are most concerned with is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%223.0.0+beta1%22\r\n\r\nHowever, I might suggest https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/13893 would be a good one to tackle. It's a little tricky, but actually is helpful to OQS even without pluggable signatures. Wouldn't it be cool if you could load X509 certs using standard OpenSSL 3.0 using OQS algs (even if you can't actually use those certs in libssl)? If you also had encoders/decoders implemented in your provider then (in theory) you should be able to use the standard openssl \"x509\" app to create and examine such certs.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-19T11:31:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
