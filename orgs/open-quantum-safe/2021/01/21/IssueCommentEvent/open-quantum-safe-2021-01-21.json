The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/764396765","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-764396765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":764396765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NDM5Njc2NQ==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-21T05:48:31Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T05:48:31Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":">  I don't know is whether pushing the image will work. \r\n\r\nWhat I read, it should.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could load X509 certs using standard OpenSSL 3.0 using OQS algs\r\n\r\nLooking into it -- particularly interesting as we can already generate OQS X509 certs (using the 1.1.1 fork), so have something to test against.\r\n\r\nSo if I understand the goal right, one would need to create an EVP_PKEY given the appID, iff a matching provider decoder can parse the X509 key data (to keep the API of `x509_pubkey_decode` stable)? At first glance this indeed doesn't look quite straightforward, but let me dig and understand more how all those pieces fit together....","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-01-21T17:13:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
