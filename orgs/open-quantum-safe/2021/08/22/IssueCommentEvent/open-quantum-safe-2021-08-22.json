The Golang wrapper did have instructions on how to do so, so for consistency and benefit to future readers, I updated this repo's one too.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

(If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ no] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?
