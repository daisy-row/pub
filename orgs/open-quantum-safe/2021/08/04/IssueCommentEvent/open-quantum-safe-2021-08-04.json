It seems that he is still missing in the upstream yml-file which could be the cause.\r\n\r\nThe sse2 and ssse3 dependencies are due to the AES-implementation still bundled with the Dilithium code. The reason the script might have not picked it up is because the upstream-yml defines it in a `common_aes` dependency.\r\nHowever, sse2 and ssse3 flags should be redundant when defining avx2, at least GCC makes their intrinsics implicitly available with the -mavx2 flag.\r\nLooking at other schemes, Falcon for example also uses sse2 intrinsics but only sets the avx2 flag.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-08-04T11:55:38Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

all code is designed such that it can not only be configured at compile time to deal with different CPU feature sets (e.g., presence/absence of AVX2) but also handle those gracefully at runtime, e.g, by automatically falling back to a non-optimised version of the same functionality.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all code compiled with, e.g., `-mavx2` should also run without error on CPUs that do *not* have support for all features (AVX2 in this example).\r\n\r\nTo help with this, we will integrate the [CPU features](https://github.com/google/cpu_features) library and for starters will add warnings if the library is running on a CPU with a feature set different from the one encountered during build (reducing the surprise when one encounters an `illegal instruction exception` during execution
