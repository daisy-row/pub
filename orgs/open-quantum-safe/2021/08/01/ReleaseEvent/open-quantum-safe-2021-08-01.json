More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype of liboqs-based key exchange for TLS 1.3 using the OpenSSL 3 (alpha) provider integration mechanism.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, and nginx.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is release candidate 3 for version 0.7.0 of liboqs.  It was released on August 1, 2021.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.6.0 release of liboqs. \r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- Update BIKE to Round 3 (version 3.2) -- add BIKE1, BIKE3, remove BIKE1-L1-CPA, BIKE1-L1-FO, BIKE1-L3-CPA, BIKE1-L3-FO\r\n- Update NTRU Prime implementation\r\n- Update SIKE implementation\r\n- Remove OQS\\_KEM\\_DEFAULT alias\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Remove OQS\\_SIG\\_DEFAULT alias\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Allow liboqs to build on other architectures, with preliminary builds on ppc64le and x86.\r\n- Support for building liboqs on Apple Silicon\r\n- New algorithm datasheets with more details on implementations.\r\n- Optimized SHA-256 implementation on ARMv8 with crypto extensions.\r\n","discussion_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/discussions/1062","short_description_html":"<h1>liboqs version 0.7.0-rc3</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
