On the [result page of signature algorithms memory usage](https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/visualization/mem_sig.html), the unit of the values in the table is not specified.

The labels are \"keygen/s\", \"sign/s\", and \"verify/s\" respectively, same as those in [SIG algorithms runtime performance](https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/visualization/speed_sig.html).
