In particular, I've started off with more \"standalone\" type jobs, which include:\r\n- alpine (2 jobs - with OpenSSL and without)\r\n- address sanitizer (1 job) (currently disabled until #1067 lands)\r\n- ARM emulation jobs (1 job - armhf)\r\n\r\nNothing stops us from moving other jobs over as well, such as the main Ubuntu x86_64 and i386 jobs, or the macOS jobs, or even the Windows jobs.  But I wanted to get initial feedback and discussion of strategy.  This currently doesn't affect triggering of downstream jobs (when a merge to main happens) or Travis/Appveyor (except for filtering branches of the form `ghactionsonly-*` from being run on those other CI platforms, allowing us to test just this one CI system).\r\n\r\nAlthough the build shows as red, if the only failure is CircleCI, then that's due to there being no jobs that are meant to be run on CircleCI due to the `ghactionsonly-*` filtering currently going on.  That problem should not be present on other branches.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/893179976","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1069#issuecomment-893179976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1069","id":893179976,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c41PNhI","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-05T05:40:30Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T05:40:30Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @dstebila for setting this up/giving this a try! This seems to be a reasonable way out of our (C)CI timing problems -- assuming GHActions doesn't impose similar limitations once more tests are running there at the same time: Does anyone know about that -- short of trying it by moving over all jobs? \r\n\r\nJudging from the code and run logs, the approach looks good to me: Same baseline containers, very similar test code, better runtime.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, this adds to our CI \"zoo\". Or is the idea to move _everything_ over to GHActions? If so (my personal preference to not deal with different CI system's quirks), I'd think we'd need to add `ssh(d)` support to our CI containers and do something similar to [this](https://github.com/marketplace?category=testing&type=actions&query=ssh+) to enable SSH access to debug problems with CI.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-08-05T05:40:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

But I wanted to get initial feedback and discussion of strategy.  This currently doesn't affect triggering of downstream jobs (when a merge to main happens) or Travis/Appveyor (except for filtering branches of the form `ghactionsonly-*` from being run on those other CI platforms, allowing us to test just this one CI system).\r\n\r\nAlthough the build shows as red, if the only failure is CircleCI, then that's due to there being no jobs that are meant to be run on CircleCI due to the `ghactionsonly-*` filtering currently going on.

This seems to be a reasonable way out of our (C)CI timing problems -- assuming GHActions doesn't impose similar limitations once more tests are running there at the same time: Does anyone know about that -- short of trying it by moving over all jobs?\r\n\r\nPQClean does much of its testing on Github Actions, with many more jobs than we have, and does not seem to encounter usage limitations.\r\n\r\n> Judging from the code and run logs, the approach looks good to me: Same baseline containers, very similar test code, better runtime.\r\n> On the negative side, this adds to our CI \"zoo\". \r\n\r\nGiven that the jobs are very similar, I feel like this isn't too much of a burden. Getting started with a new CI provider is a cost, but now that I've done that hopefully it's not too much of a burden to keep it going.  \r\n\r\n> Or is the idea to move _everything_ over to GHActions? If so (my personal preference to not deal with different CI system's quirks), I'd think we'd need to add `ssh(d)` support to our CI containers and do something similar to [this](https://github.com/marketplace?category=testing&type=actions&query=ssh+) to enable SSH access to debug problems with CI.\r\n\r\nI do not intend at this point to move everything over to Github Actions.  I just wanted to reduce some of the CI backlog we'd been encountering due to over-reliance on the free part of CircleCI.

In particular, I've started off with more \"standalone\" type jobs, which include:\r\n- alpine (2 jobs - with OpenSSL and without)\r\n- address sanitizer (1 job) (currently disabled until #1067 lands)\r\n- ARM emulation jobs (1 job - armhf)\r\n\r\nNothing stops us from moving other jobs over as well, such as the main Ubuntu x86_64 and i386 jobs, or the macOS jobs, or even the Windows jobs.  But I wanted to get initial feedback and discussion of strategy.  This currently doesn't affect triggering of downstream jobs (when a merge to main happens) or Travis/Appveyor (except for filtering branches of the form `ghactionsonly-*` from being run on those other CI platforms, allowing us to test just this one CI system).\r\n\r\nAlthough the build shows as red, if the only failure is CircleCI, then that's due to there being no jobs that are meant to be run on CircleCI due to the `ghactionsonly-*` filtering currently going on.

However, this does not ascertain that the NIST levels in `liboqs` and `oqs-openssl` do match, as the former are not read from the datasheets. Hence, this code does not fix #315. It would, of course, if similar NIST level \"doc->src ascertainment\" would be added to `liboqs`: Is that your intention?\r\n\r\nDo you mean that there's no check that the security levels in liboqs/docs/algorithms/*/*.yml and e.g. liboqs/src/kem/sike/kem_sike.c (and all other KEMs and SIGs) match?  If so, I agree that's something that should be checked, but should be done in liboqs.  \r\n\r\nIf you mean that there's something else here in OQS-OpenSSL where matching security levels are not checked, then I'm not sure what you're referring to.  I notice that in openssl/oqs-template/generate.yml there are (for KEMs) `extra_nids` hybrid groups that mix with e.g. x25519 that could be checked, and (for SIGs) the `mix_with` hybrid combinations that could be checked.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-08-05T13:56:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
