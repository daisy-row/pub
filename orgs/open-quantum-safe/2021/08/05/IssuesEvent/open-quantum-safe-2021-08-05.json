How to proceed?  Widen the matrix/check more environments (gcc 9, 10 on Linux; M1 on OSX; msys2/mingw in Win)? Fix these (e.g., could #887 make BIKE be usable on Windows)? \"Just\" document in #892? What else?\r\n\r\nFeedback solicited @jschanck @dstebila @christianpaquin @xvzcf ","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-08-05T06:27:45Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
