In particular, I've started off with more \"standalone\" type jobs, which include:\r\n- alpine (2 jobs - with OpenSSL and without)\r\n- address sanitizer (1 job) (currently disabled until #1067 lands)\r\n- ARM emulation jobs (1 job - armhf)\r\n\r\nNothing stops us from moving other jobs over as well, such as the main Ubuntu x86_64 and i386 jobs, or the macOS jobs, or even the Windows jobs.  But I wanted to get initial feedback and discussion of strategy.  This currently doesn't affect triggering of downstream jobs (when a merge to main happens) or Travis/Appveyor (except for filtering branches of the form `ghactionsonly-*` from being run on those other CI platforms, allowing us to test just this one CI system).\r\n\r\nAlthough the build shows as red, if the only failure is CircleCI, then that's due to there being no jobs that are meant to be run on CircleCI due to the `ghactionsonly-*` filtering currently going on.  That problem should not be present on other branches.","created_at":"2021-08-05T01:47:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T05:53:19Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ff05c74a08b22bb05853996991cc2436a257ba9","assignee":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":486323384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODYzMjMzODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/labels/refactor","name":"refactor","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Reorganizing

In particular, I've started off with more \"standalone\" type jobs, which include:\r\n- alpine (2 jobs - with OpenSSL and without)\r\n- address sanitizer (1 job) (currently disabled until #1067 lands)\r\n- ARM emulation jobs (1 job - armhf)\r\n\r\nNothing stops us from moving other jobs over as well, such as the main Ubuntu x86_64 and i386 jobs, or the macOS jobs, or even the Windows jobs.  But I wanted to get initial feedback and discussion of strategy.  This currently doesn't affect triggering of downstream jobs (when a merge to main happens) or Travis/Appveyor (except for filtering branches of the form `ghactionsonly-*` from being run on those other CI platforms, allowing us to test just this one CI system).\r\n\r\nAlthough the build shows as red, if the only failure is CircleCI, then that's due to there being no jobs that are meant to be run on CircleCI due to the `ghactionsonly-*` filtering currently going on.  That problem should not be present on other branches.","created_at":"2021-08-05T01:47:13Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T13:50:03Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9aa2e6dcec2767403ce3588f1742583d275a10cd","assignee":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":486323384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0ODYzMjMzODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/labels/refactor","name":"refactor","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Reorganizing
