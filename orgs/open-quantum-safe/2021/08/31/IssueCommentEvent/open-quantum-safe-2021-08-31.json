(Sometimes called _API version_ or _SOVERSION_). This is different thing than usual project versioning. It's purpose to maintain binary (ABI) compatibility between executable binaries and shared libraries. Currently, liboqs just copy project version into SOVERSION which does not reflect backward incompatible ABI changes (which may cause obscure program errors when binary that is linked to a newer library used on system with older library â€” current versioning allows this, because major version number (that signifying backward-incompatible ABI change) is not incremented (while library does have backward incompatible ABI changes).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n* General explanation https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12637841/what-is-the-soname-option-for-building-shared-libraries-for\r\n* GNU tooling https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html (Note that their `-version-info` arguments order is different from what will actually appear in the library suffix - they say `current:revision:age`, but library will be named like `liboqs.so..current.age.revision`).\r\n* Cmake property https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/SOVERSION.html\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/908987896","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1081#issuecomment-908987896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1081","id":908987896,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c42Lg34","user":{"login":"vt-alt","id":36664211,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjY0MjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36664211?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt","html_url":"https://github.com/vt-alt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vt-alt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-31T07:50:51Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T07:50:51Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think **not** increasing SOVERSION while having ABI change can cause more problems, than increasing SOVERSION while ABI is not changed.\r\n\r\nThus, I would recommend to increase SOVERSION for libqos if you are not sure that ABI changed or not, on every release (no need more frequent). And especially while it is not stabilized library (I conclude this from its version starting from `0`).\r\n\r\nThis SOVERSION change will force all library clients to ne rebuild with a new library. This is OK if there are few clients. As seems to be case for liboqs. (In ALT Linux we have only OQS openssh.)\r\n\r\nIf there are many clients, thing will be getting much more [complicated](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html), and it's better to only increase SOVERSION when needed.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-08-31T07:50:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
