Can I seek your clarification on what kind of TLS connection is set up (what data is communicated between client and server)  in the TLS demo of the readme file?\r\n\r\n2. Personally, I created a self-signed root server where it’s signature algorithm is Falcon1024 and a  dilithium2 server where it is signed by the root server using Falcon1024. The following is the result that I got when I run the client and the server:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51086295/132183850-ba64f267-079f-410c-85ff-ba8127206506.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51086295/132183080-68335131-0780-4bed-9f40-14c3b44a6c65.png)\r\n\r\nI don’t get why there is an error (underlined in red) as dilithium2_srv is not a self-signed CA because it is signed by the root CA using falcon1024.\r\n \r\n  \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51086295/132183201-778dfbdf-81d8-4222-94aa-03e9cdb58f48.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. I also want to ask if OQS is able to create a certificate chain and then set up a TLS connection between client A and client B as shown above ? \r\n\r\nThank you very much and hope to hear from you soon!\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-09-18T20:07:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
