The \"data\" is just your data from the objects.txt input file that you wrote in a reformatted form. And the \"structural\" bits seem trivial.\r\n\r\nThe objects.pl script is available under the Apache license and therefore you are allowed to amend it. So one \"hack\" you could do to \"fix\" this, is for your scripts to create a temporary copy of objects.pl and then automatically hack it to amend the generated copyright message to one of your choosing. Create the header files using the hacked objects.pl, and then delete it.\r\n\r\nOr alternatively, if you're willing to have the Apache 2 licensed code in your repo, just take a copy of that one script. Modify the copyright message it generates and commit the script, and use your copy of the script henceforth.
