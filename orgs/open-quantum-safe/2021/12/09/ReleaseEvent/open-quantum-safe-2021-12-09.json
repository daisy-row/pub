More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype of liboqs-based key exchange for TLS 1.3 using the OpenSSL 3 (alpha) provider integration mechanism.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is release candidate 1 for version 0.7.1 of liboqs.  It was released on December 9, 2021.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.7.0 release of liboqs. \r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- Add NTRU level 5 parameter sets (ntruhps40961229, ntruhrss1373)\r\n- Add NTRU Prime level 5 parameter sets (ntrulpr1277, sntrup1277)\r\n- Add ARMv8 aarch64 optimized implementations of Kyber and SABER\r\n- Minor updates to Kyber, NTRU, NTRU Prime, and SIKE implementations\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Minor updates to Dilithium implementation\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Optimized AES implementation on ARMv8 with crypto extensions.\r\n- Preliminary support for building on S390x platform\r\n- Improved build configurations on ARM platforms\r\n- Improvements to benchmarking harness, with improved precision on ARM platforms\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Use Github Actions for some CI by @dstebila in
