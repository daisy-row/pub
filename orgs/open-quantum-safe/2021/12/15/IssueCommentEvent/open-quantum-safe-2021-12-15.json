Additionally, it slightly reduces the diff between our code and the copy in liboqs by providing a code path for calling `OQS_randombytes` in `randomness.c` and by defining `PICNIC_EXPORT` instead of `PICNIC_STATIC`. `PICNIC_STATIC` is intended for the static build for tests and benchmarking and is intended as an internal flag. With these changes future imports of the Picnic code base should be a bit smoother and should only require a check that `oqs_picnic_macros.h` is still included in the correct places.\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?
