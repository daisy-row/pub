Additionally, it slightly reduces the diff between our code and the copy in liboqs by providing a code path for calling `OQS_randombytes` in `randomness.c` and by defining `PICNIC_EXPORT` instead of `PICNIC_STATIC`. `PICNIC_STATIC` is intended for the static build for tests and benchmarking and is intended as an internal flag. With these changes future imports of the Picnic code base should be a bit smoother and should only require a check that `oqs_picnic_macros.h` is still included in the correct places.\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.): It doesn't.\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.): It doesn't.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/995611498","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1158#issuecomment-995611498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1158","id":995611498,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c47V9Nq","user":{"login":"sebastinas","id":114613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-16T09:52:55Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T09:52:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I'll take the time to fix the AVX2/SSE2/NEON handling to better match what's done for other implementations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/995611498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-12-16T09:52:55Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
