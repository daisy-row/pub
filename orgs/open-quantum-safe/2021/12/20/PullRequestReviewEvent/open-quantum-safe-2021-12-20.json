Additionally, it slightly reduces the diff between our code and the copy in liboqs by providing a code path for calling `OQS_randombytes` in `randomness.c` and by defining `PICNIC_EXPORT` instead of `PICNIC_STATIC`. `PICNIC_STATIC` is intended for the static build for tests and benchmarking and is intended as an internal flag. With these changes future imports of the Picnic code base should be a bit smoother and should only require a check that `oqs_picnic_macros.h` is still included in the correct places.\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.): It doesn't.\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.): It doesn't.","created_at":"2021-12-15T16:29:42Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T15:50:42Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15a09da76930f4d874a0d9cc61c585eb2f01442c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/8718bbebd509c934dd088ff9c1815dbef5b7ff22","head":{"label":"sebastinas:picnic-3.0.7","ref":"picnic-3.0.7","sha":"8718bbebd509c934dd088ff9c1815dbef5b7ff22","user":{"login":"sebastinas","id":114613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":438691395,"node_id":"R_kgDOGiXmQw","name":"liboqs","full_name":"sebastinas/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sebastinas","id":114613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas","html_url":"https://github.com/sebastinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sebastinas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sebastinas/liboqs","description":"C

Since s390x (64-bit big-endian) and ppc64le\n(64-bit POWER) are already supported, this shouldn't be an issue.\nThis PR adds support for 64-bit POWER on big-endian.\nThere is already support for one 64-bit big-endian architecture (s390x).\nThere is also support for ppc64le (64-bit POWER little-endian).\nSo this PR shouldn't add much overhead.\n\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\n\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\n* [ ] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.)\n\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration
