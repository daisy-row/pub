See for example https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8e22871ff6cfdc69dba6748bbd902ed0fb316fc3/src/kem/kyber/kem_kyber_512.c#L67-L83 for missing `OQS_DIST_BUILD` guards in the case of `aarch64` code. Instead of changing the implementation we could of course also document `OQS_DIST_BUILD` as not applicable for ARM64.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-12-07T06:58:32Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
