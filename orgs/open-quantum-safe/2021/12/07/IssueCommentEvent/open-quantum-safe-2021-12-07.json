So the API would need to be adapted.  We'd also have to consider whether to include mechanisms for reading/writing the secret key to/from files, or whether to leave that to the caller.    Safe management of this update operation is critical as reuse / loss of state can be catastrophic for security.\r\n\r\nCheck out related literature and implementations: https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference, https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/470.pdf, http://www.amphawa.eu/data/icmu-paper.pdf\r\n\r\nEventually we'll also want to consider what can be done in OQS-OpenSSL.  It will be hard to add stateful HBS signing (since the OpenSSL signature API would have to be modified at many places) but might be easier and sufficient for limited applications to first add verification for stateful HBS schemes, since those don't actually require any state to be stored/updated (and thus have the same API for verification).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/988238021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-12-07T20:21:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
