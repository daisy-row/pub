I'm not suggesting we try to support those at this point in time.  However, one set of build failures (see e.g. [this build log](https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=liboqs&arch=mips64el&ver=0.7.0.27.gba5b61a7%2Bdfsg-1&stamp=1637141544&raw=0)) seems to be related to SIKE's config.h header file thinking it's on an unsupported architecture, but apparently CMake still tried to compile SIKE.  In other words, there seems to be a mismatch between architectures where CMake thinks it should try compiling SIKE and architectures that SIKE's config.h header file is willing to support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-26T14:02:23Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
