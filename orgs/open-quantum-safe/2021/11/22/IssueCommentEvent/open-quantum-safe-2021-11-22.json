After simply running `find appveyor* src tests -name '*.[chS]' | xargs astyle --options=.astylerc` everything keeps building and testing just fine -- after changing 2440 files to bring them \"in line\", though...\r\n> \r\n> Edit/Add: Running a less drastic `find appveyor.* src tests -name '*.[Sch]' | xargs sed -i 's/\\r//'` indeed only highlights the file(s) above: PR #1133 . Will keep permitting possible future \"visual\" inspection of `copy_from_upstream` results.\r\n\r\nRunning astyle on all external code seemed to be too disruptive.

Very realistic! In fact, it very much mirrors our own demo. \r\n\r\n1. start apache httpd built against wolfssl and liboqs\r\n2. start wireshark (locally built, not docker image) and watch loopback\r\n3. execute curl using falcon root cert and specify quantum safe group beside `--curves`. \r\n4. show analyze tls traffic in wireshark. \r\n\r\nIf you stay tuned to wolfSSL's YouTube channel or get notifications of wolfSSL's webinars, sometime in the month of December, you'll probably be able to see such a demo. \r\n\r\nFrom what I remember stock, wireshark should recognize the traffic as TLS but not understand any of the groups nor signature schemes.  So, maybe something else has gone wrong? \r\n\r\nAnother minor point is that you specify `frodo640aes` but please note that the patch does not allow for recognition of that particular codepoint.  Only SABER, KYBER, NTRU and their hybrids codepoints are recognized.  Of course, if you would like to add it, please feel free to do so.

I'm not suggesting we try to support those at this point in time.  However, one set of build failures (see e.g. [this build log](https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=liboqs&arch=mips64el&ver=0.7.0.27.gba5b61a7%2Bdfsg-1&stamp=1637141544&raw=0)) seems to be related to SIKE's config.h header file thinking it's on an unsupported architecture, but apparently CMake still tried to compile SIKE.  In other words, there seems to be a mismatch between architectures where CMake thinks it should try compiling SIKE and architectures that SIKE's config.h header file is willing to support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/975953590","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128#issuecomment-975953590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128","id":975953590,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c46K962","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-22T21:57:01Z","updated_at":"2021-11-22T21:57:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"SIKE's config does explicitly reject unsupported platforms.
