Therefore, supporting only \"half\" PK key pairs as EVP keys makes sense. This also allows for loading (and storing) \"true\" private EVP OQS keys now. This in turn in in contrast with the oqs-openssl [implementation of storing (persisting) public key material together with private key material](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/8c93484150cb30debce06db7289c563d97eaafdb/crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c#L1037-L1038).\r\n\r\nThis issue is about discussing whether we should (also) do this in oqs-provider, ensuring interoperability with oqs-openssl-generated (persistent) data or whether we want to be more efficient and only store private key material in oqs-provider EVP keys, but thus breaking interoperability between oqs-provider and oqs-openssl(1.1.1). \r\n\r\nThe question also will be how to match private and public keys via the provider: Simply comparing key material (as is possible now), doing actual sign/verify operations, or some \"hybrid\" (hashing) based approach. Example code currently [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/12fc72cd21cf6735016aff58d5fa40ee6b4fb6b2/oqsprov/oqs_kmgmt.c#L101-L145).\r\n\r\nAlready extending the feature set is that oqs-provider supports more hybrid KEM mechanisms. But for full TLS signature operations oqs-openssl will remain more relevant until https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/10512 is resolved thus making interoperability between oqs-openssl and oqs-provider desirable for users (of most functionality and future-proof OpenSSL).\r\n\r\nThoughts welcome, @dstebila @christianpaquin ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/32/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/32/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/965403103","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/32#issuecomment-965403103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/32","id":965403103,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l845iuHf","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-10T15:30:20Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T15:30:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"This is a reminder that the use of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding (for hybrid signatures) is something to reconsider (see #40):","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/965403103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-10T15:30:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
