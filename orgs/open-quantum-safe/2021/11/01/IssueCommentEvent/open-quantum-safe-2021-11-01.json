But (I decided) No is more important currently, because the provider code should be as close to OSSL3 master as possible: Otherwise, a) (also my) contributions to OSSL3 become available only with a long delay (and/or require new manual tagging and/or even separate provider branches -- which is no effort I'm willing to expend at this time of development); b) breakage makes us aware of OSSL3 changes otherwise going unnoticed -> For as long as no distro makes OSSL3 the default OpenSSL version I thus much prefer a bleeding edge provider to be (failing :) fast. Slow comes later :-)\r\n\r\n> Do you know if there is a solution planned in openssl3 that lets providers use these tests without patching the openssl3 base?\r\n\r\nThat's precisely what I'm doing now (with en/decoder and probably extending to all tests to get rid of the patch) -- at the price of breakage as and when OSSL3 (even test) code changes. But again, I consider this goodness at this time in the OSSL3 lifecycle.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/956146786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-01T11:17:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
