I'll make a new issue shortly.\r\n>Finally, for curiosity: Is this code markedly faster than the ARM code presently generated? Worthwhile updating [profiling](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling) with this?\r\nI hope so, but I haven't performed any benchmarking yet. This was a case of @dstebila asking me to pull in pqclean's kyber code and blindly doing it. :-) I've only skimmed the associated [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/986.pdf), but it looks like there is a decent speed improvement over past kyber implementations.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-01T18:12:26Z","updated_at":"2021-11-01T18:12:26Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1117#discussion_r740425459","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1117","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/740425459"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1117#discussion_r740425459"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1117"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/740425459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":36,"original_line":36,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":739982338},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1117","id":770114204,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c4t5wKc","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1117","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1117.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1117.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1117","number":1117,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Adding support for multiple upstream to copy_from_upstream, as well as pqclean's aarch64 kyber implementation","user":{"login":"Martyrshot","id":6541356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6541356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot","html_url":"https://github.com/Martyrshot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nThere are two parts to this PR:\r\n1) Adding support to copy_from_upstream.py to specify specific upstreams for arch-specific implementations\r\n2) Pulling in pqclean's aarch64 optimized implementation of Kyber.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
