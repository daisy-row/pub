While this is a very minute issue, some of tools employed in Debian packaging have minor problems with it (I should probably find a way to deal with them too). But if there is no difference, maybe the same newline convention could be used throughout the project? If this could not be done for `appveyor.yml` due to usage in Windows, maybe then line endings could be unified throughout all `*asm.S` files?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-23T06:35:36Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
