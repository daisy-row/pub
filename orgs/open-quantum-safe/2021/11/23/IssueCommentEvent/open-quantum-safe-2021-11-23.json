Very realistic!\r\n\r\nThanks for that confirmation. Could you then please help fill my \"wireshark knowledge holes\" as per the below?\r\n\r\n> From what I remember stock, wireshark should recognize the traffic as TLS but not understand any of the groups nor signature schemes. So, maybe something else has gone wrong?\r\n\r\nIt looks like this: A plain vanilla wireshark running with the filter \"ip.addr == 149.81.106.123\" does not recognize TLS traffic when observing curl (successfully) connecting to our OQS-test server: `docker run -it openquantumsafe/curl sh -c \"curl -k https://test.openquantumsafe.org:6007 --curves kyber512\"` but shows this:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57787676/142979173-1bbfdfb3-e473-4d5f-8a15-d49edde8ae8c.png)\r\n\r\nLooks like it considers this X11 traffic... What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n> Another minor point is that you specify frodo640aes but please note that the patch does not allow for recognition of that particular codepoint. Only SABER, KYBER, NTRU and their hybrids codepoints are recognized. Of course, if you would like to add it, please feel free to do so.\r\n\r\nAgreed, so see above: This is contacting a \"Kyber-enabled\" port (6007) which I think the patched wireshark should work with, right?\r\n\r\n> Perhaps it would be more appropriate if this was done more like chromium and just built without docker? [...] Please let me know your opinion on this matter.\r\n\r\nAgreed again: I'm all for taking small steps: \r\n1) Probably should be a shell script building a working `wireshark` on an Ubuntu x64\r\n2) Adding the patch then\r\n3) Running this against the test server with an algorithm readily supported by the patch demoing the scenario described above\r\n4) Adding all other OQS algorithms thus creating a wireshark working for both wolfssl and oqs-openssl\r\n5) Moving (and testing) the build to Alpine (but maybe only later -- this is just to save size)\r\n6) Moving it into a docker image\r\n\r\n--> What'd you say, @anhu: Reasonable? Any steps you could contribute (without going against your business commitments)? With a bit of help around understanding wireshark I think I may also take them on if that'd ease things.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/976198625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-23T06:30:45Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

If this could not be done for `appveyor.yml` due to usage in Windows, maybe then line endings could be unified throughout all `*asm.S` files?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/976200279","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1129#issuecomment-976200279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1129","id":976200279,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c46L6JX","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-23T06:35:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T06:35:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I would prefer all the files required to build liboqs on Linux-type systems to have LF line endings.\r\n\r\nThanks for the clear statement.

Opinions? @dstebila ?\r\n\r\nIs it easy for a Docker-ized wireshark to be able to capture transmissions between things outside of its container?  If someone has to successfully orchestrate three containers (wireshark, Apache, curl) to be able to run this, that's pretty rough.  In which case I'd be inclined to throw Apache and curl in there, so that they have something that they can more easily start using.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/976669321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-23T14:57:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

In other words, there seems to be a mismatch between architectures where CMake thinks it should try compiling SIKE and architectures that SIKE's config.h header file is willing to support.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/976697750","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128#issuecomment-976697750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1128","id":976697750,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c46NzmW","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-23T15:17:00Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T15:17:00Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> There [already is a guard](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8df1a81dd7e01901456f8666456b107cb2ab972d/CMakeLists.txt#L68-L72) explicitly overruled in this build.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about adding a guard [here in the CMakeLists](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/kem/sike/CMakeLists.txt#L3) to list the SIKE supported archs, to avoid the preprocessor's failure [here in the config](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/kem/sike/external/config.h#L73\r\n).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/976697750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-23T15:17:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
