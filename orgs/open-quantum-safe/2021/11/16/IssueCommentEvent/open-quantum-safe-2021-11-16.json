I thus only copied over the files `copy_from_upstream.py`, `update_upstream_alg_docs.py` and `update_docs_from_yaml.py` (from martyrshot/updating-docs-for-multiple-upstreams) and then executed those in liboqs main, but to no avail:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 copy_from_upstream.py copy\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"copy_from_upstream.py\", line 658, in <module>\r\n    copy_from_upstream()\r\n  File \"copy_from_upstream.py\", line 587, in copy_from_upstream\r\n    update_upstream_alg_docs.do_it(os.environ['LIBOQS_DIR'])\r\n  File \"/home/mib/git/oqs/liboqs/scripts/copy_from_upstream/update_upstream_alg_docs.py\", line 305, in do_it\r\n    update_upstream_kem_alg_docs(liboqs_root, instructions['kems'], instructions['upstreams'], write_changes)\r\n  File \"/home/mib/git/oqs/liboqs/scripts/copy_from_upstream/update_upstream_alg_docs.py\", line 117, in update_upstream_kem_alg_docs\r\n    oqs_yaml['primary-upstream']['source'] = rhs_if_not_equal(oqs_yaml['primary-upstream']['source'], (\"{}/commit/{}\"+patches_done).format(upstream_base_url, ui['git_commit']), \"primary-upstream\")\r\nKeyError: 'primary-upstream'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow --not cutting corners any more-- I just cloned martyrshot/liboqs and moved to branch \"updating-docs-for-multiple-upstreams\" and ran these in their respective directories:\r\n```\r\n$ python3 copy_from_upstream.py copy\r\n$ python3 update_docs_from_yaml.py\r\n``` \r\n--> As you stated, no errors.
