The litmus test this passes is successful execution of `python3 copy_from_upstream.py copy`, right? There is one step missing though (and I wonder why we have not automated that): Running `python3 update_docs_from_yaml.py` to generate the .MD files: Those should be the files we read/check (treating the YML files only as intermediate/machine representations). If you rightfully want to go to bed now I'll manually run this from your repo to check things. Before merge, however, please amend the PR with the results of running that script too.

The litmus test this passes is successful execution of `python3 copy_from_upstream.py copy`, right? There is one step missing though (and I wonder why we have not automated that): Running `python3 update_docs_from_yaml.py` to generate the .MD files: Those should be the files we read/check (treating the YML files only as intermediate/machine representations). If you rightfully want to go to bed now I'll manually run this from your repo to check things. Before merge, however, please amend the PR with the results of running that script too. Also I wonder why this PR contains so many commits (?)\r\nUpdate: `copy_from_upstream.py` (and in consequence `update_upstream_alg_docs.py`) works OK when using the scripts from this PR. However, generating the markdown files fails (with reference to the same token 'upstream', so probably also related to the update):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 scripts/update_docs_from_yaml.py \r\nUpdating ./docs/algorithms/kem/bike.md\r\nUpdating ./docs/algorithms/kem/classic_mceliece.md\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"scripts/update_docs_from_yaml.py\", line 44, in <module>\r\n    out_md.write('- **Implementation source**: {}'.format(kem_yaml['upstream']))\r\nKeyError: 'upstream'\r\n```\r\n","commit_id":"aa4beb1b394e34c35f76ceac7456a790079a34e5","submitted_at":"2021-11-16T07:01:20Z","state":"changes_requested","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1123#pullrequestreview-806884484","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1123","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1123#pullrequestreview-806884484"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1123"}}},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1123","id":781351279,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c4uknlv","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1123","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1123.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1123.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1123","number":1123,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Adding multiple upstream support to doc generation","user":{"login":"Martyrshot","id":6541356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6541356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot","html_url":"https://github.com/Martyrshot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue discovered by  Michael (https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1117#issuecomment-969116802).\r\n\r\nThis will update legacy yaml files so that the new format is followed, and when a yaml file is updated the script it indicate it has done so.
