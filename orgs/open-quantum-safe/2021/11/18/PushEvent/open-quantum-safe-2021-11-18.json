Fix by @DStebila\r\n\r\n* No longer checking spdx on files copied from upstream\r\n\r\n* Added compiler checking for gcc. Must be at least 9.4.0.\r\n\r\n* Added pqclean's aarch64 optimized kyber implementation to liboqs\r\n\r\n* stripping asimd flag for ARM64_V8 as it isn't needed and will cause errors when trying to specify it during compilation\r\n\r\n* Updated kyber docs\r\n\r\n* Updated kyber markdown so that no-secret-dependent-branching-checked-by-valgrind correctly says false for the new aarch64 implementation\r\n\r\n* Added automated updating of legacy yaml format, and added some yaml files which don't get automatically updated\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug where optimized upstreams would use the primary upstream's supported platform\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug with copy_from_upstream.py's verify function where it would always use the default upstream location when comparing with diff\r\n\r\n* Added reporting for implementations that are in upstream but aren't yet integrated into liboqs\r\n\r\n* Added support to ignore implementations from upstream in copy_from_upstream.yml. This is to prevent implementations that haven't been integrated into LIBOQS yet from being pulled in by copy_from_upstream.py. It also silences the warning when verifying.\r\n\r\n* Adding updated ymls and md files for docs\r\n\r\n* copy_from_upstream.py now also calls update_docs_from_yaml.py","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commits/769412623cc5b5ce936bdd3d60aad4d32e44a31f"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-18T05:56:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
