This Github presented how to build the OQS OpenSSL library in Mac, Linux, and Windows environments. Where Mac is a Mac with an Intel chip (x86). However, the build method for Mac with Apple-M1 chip is not provided, so I would like to ask if you can know how to build it. Thanks for reading this long article.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/982550486","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/341#issuecomment-982550486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/341","id":982550486,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA_fpb846kIfW","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-30T11:32:04Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T11:32:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Considering the ARM-based Linux environment, I would like to know if there are specific instructions for building the fork. \r\n\r\nI'm afraid I don't have such environment at my disposal to check what error occurs, so please provide suitable logfile output to help me understand the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/982550486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-11-30T11:32:04Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
