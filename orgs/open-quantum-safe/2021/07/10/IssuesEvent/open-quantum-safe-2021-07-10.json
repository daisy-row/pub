Please check out #26 for a first cut at resolving this issue: Would you want to make a suggestion how to fix things now? Either \"registering\" your new hybrid NIDs via an amend-commit to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/313 or amend #26 (change extra-NIDs) here. I'd prefer the latter (updating extra NIDs) to not make things more complicated in oqs-openssl.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-10T05:05:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
