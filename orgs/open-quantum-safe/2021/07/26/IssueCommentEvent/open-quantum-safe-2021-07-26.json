I was running some performance tests to see the difference between a classical TLS sessions and post-quantum TLS session using the built in `s_time` client in the OQS-OpenSSL library. I connected to the server like so:\r\n\r\nfor OQS TLS session:\r\n ` /opt/openssl/apps/openssl s_time -connect host:port1 -curves kyber512`\r\n\r\nfor classical TLS session:\r\n' ` /opt/openssl/apps/openssl s_time -connect host:port2`\r\n\r\nWhere port1 uses the dilithium2 signed certificate and port2 uses a classical RSA signed certificate. \r\n\r\nThese are the results when running `s_time` for 30 seconds per run: \r\n\r\n![{83373F40-C401-4138-8826-FAC10FE668CE}](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23386187/120106584-e4d1b500-c15d-11eb-9142-6df6090de45b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the results from doing a localhost test where I start an openssl server like so: \r\n\r\n` /opt/openssl/apps/openssl s_server -cert <SIG_ALG>_srv.crt -key <SIG_ALG>_srv.key -www -tls1_3 -groups kyber512`\r\n\r\n![{84F7549B-4298-4C51-A880-841AC51B43A0}](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23386187/120106676-4e51c380-c15e-11eb-84cd-9381fdc3700f.png)\r\n\r\nI realize that localhost testing is a little more reliable in terms of network interference and such, but i do not really understand the 50-60% dip in performance seen with the Nginx performance testing vs the 20-25% drop in performance with the localhost testing. \r\n\r\nI am running the Nginx server from within a DigitalOcean droplet. \r\n\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/886808851","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/314#issuecomment-886808851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/314","id":886808851,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA_fpb84026ET","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-26T15:35:11Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T15:35:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> https://we.tl/t-kB5ehIdV9X\r\n\r\nThanks, I've added a reference to it to https://openquantumsafe.org/research/","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-26T15:35:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
