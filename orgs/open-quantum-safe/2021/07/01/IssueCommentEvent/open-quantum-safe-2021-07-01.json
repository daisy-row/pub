Thus, the downstream \"logjam\" gets bigger and bigger: No demos aligned with `liboqs v0.6.0` can be built since its release nearly a month ago; no test server update is possible; docker images are now pretty much outdated; all app builds now fail.\r\n\r\n@alexw91, can you make a statement when you plan to merge the new IDs so we can match as per the above and move forward, too? If this wouldn't be in the next few days (?), I'd like to propose doing a separate PR to this one to move forward here. Rationale: We've stalled on this for a month now and in 2 weeks time I'll probably not be the only one to go on vacation for some time. I'd personally feel bad not having done my best to ensure all OQS \"downstream\" projects are not in \"red build status\" for all summer.\r\n\r\nIf OK for both of you (?), we can then leave this PR \"lingering\" until s2n settles and/or a standard document gets written.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-07-01T16:38:27Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
