I'd be happy to test on apple silicon, but I would need access to a machine since I only have an intel mac. The reason I picked that flag, in particular, is because I have to specify a core in order to \"turn on\" crypto extensions when compiling on a system that doesn't have them (the `+crypto` portion of `-mcpu`), and `a53` is the `generic` core used by liboqs. Without that compile flag the compiler will error saying that the extension isn't supported, but since we do a runtime check when `OQS_DIST_ARM64v8_BUILD` is specified, so we need to have those intrinsics compiled into the library.","created_at":"2021-07-29T17:49:23Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T17:49:23Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052#discussion_r679364417","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1052","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/679364417"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052#discussion_r679364417"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1052"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":36,"original_line":36,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":679289774},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1052","id":693012805,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjkzMDEyODA1","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1052","number":1052,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Adding armv8 crypto extensions to SHA256/224","user":{"login":"Martyrshot","id":6541356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6541356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot","html_url":"https://github.com/Martyrshot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nThis PR adds the armv8 crypto extensions accelerated implementation of sha256 hashblocks from supercop.

I think what might be going on there is that the lines 74-92 of common.c are protected by `OQS_DIST_ARM64v8_BUILD` which in principle would include both Linux ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi's) and Apple ARM, but the code in that section is solely Linux-focused; for example I think neither `<sys/auxv.h>` nor `getauxval` is available on macOS.  [This site](https://github.com/google/cpu_features/pull/150) shows one example of reading the CPU features on macOS. Although for Apple chips it seems like the features we want are always available (at least for now), so maybe we can simplify and just set them automatically without testing?","created_at":"2021-07-29T19:50:56Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T19:50:56Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052#discussion_r679442526","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1052","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/679442526"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052#discussion_r679442526"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1052"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":36,"original_line":36,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":679289774},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1052","id":693012805,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjkzMDEyODA1","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1052.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1052","number":1052,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Adding armv8 crypto extensions to SHA256/224","user":{"login":"Martyrshot","id":6541356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6541356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot","html_url":"https://github.com/Martyrshot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Martyrshot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nThis PR adds the armv8 crypto extensions accelerated implementation of sha256 hashblocks from supercop.
