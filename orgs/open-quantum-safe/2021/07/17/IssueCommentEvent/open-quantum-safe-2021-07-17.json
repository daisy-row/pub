So you could try to continue without it (but you could also try to install it: What about running `apt install libunwind-dev`?). What you should do at the end of building `oqs-boringssl` is test it: run `python3 oqs_scripts/try_handshake.py` in the \"<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src\" folder: If you see a \"Connected\" in the output, that part works OK.\r\n> \r\n> To the next question: If `./tool/bssl` does not exist, the `oqs-boringssl` build failed for sure. Did you run `ninja` at all? Or did you only run `cmake`?\r\n\r\nI ran `ninja` , and `./tool/bssl` exists. When I used the newly built Chromium to access the OQS test server, the error message said `NO_SHARED_GROUP` .
