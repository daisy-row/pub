OQS interop test server configuration), haproxy, openssh and chromium known to build using [liboqs v0.5.0](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.5.0). Be sure to select the proper git tag when selectively building any of the components at that liboqs level. Most notably be sure to select [OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable snapshot 2021-03](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/releases/tag/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2021-03) for OQS-openssl.\r\n\r\nChromium as attached is a ready-to-run OQS-enabled binary build for x86_64 on Ubuntu 20 using liboqs at v0.5.0: Uncompress using `tar xzvf chromium-ubuntu-0.5.0.tgz` to a directory of your choice and start browsing with QSC by running ./chrome, e.g., accessing the OQS interop test server at https://test.openquantumsafe.org: `./chrome https://test.openquantumsafe.org`.
