So, Yes, there is a very concluding list: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/oqs-template/generate.yml (unless someone adds to it :-).\r\n\r\nFor the KEMs, this PR already supports more than what OQS-OSSL111 does (which is \"only\" strength-matching P256/P384/P521) if I get it right; for SIGs, RSA3k would be required to get to the point of being able to do interop testing (as and when we get around to implement serialization and later, OSSL3 gets provider-signature support: So, RSA3k is definitely not urgent right now but I thought it might be easy for you to add while you're \"at it\").","created_at":"2021-03-19T05:34:48Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T05:34:48Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16#discussion_r597417337","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/597417337"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16#discussion_r597417337"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":167,"original_line":167,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":596979126},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16","id":593994623,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkzOTk0NjIz","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/16","number":16,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Hybrid

I think I misinterpreted RSA3k as RSA-KEM (as in the sample OSSL3 provider).\r\n\r\nYes, this PR does than OQS-OSSL111 in the sense that it also does strength-matching with X25519 and X448 in addition to P256/P384/P521. I'd add another field (e.g. `nid_hybrid_ecx`) to generate.yml to reflect that.\r\n\r\nFor hybrid signatures, it seems that we'd need ECDSA P256/P384/P521 and RSA3k to do full interop testing.
