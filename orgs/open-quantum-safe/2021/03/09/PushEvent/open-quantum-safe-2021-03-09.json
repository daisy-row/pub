from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13834)\r\n\r\n* Fix Null pointer deref in X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()\r\n\r\nThe OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts\r\nto create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data\r\ncontained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly\r\nhandle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which\r\nmight occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may\r\nsubsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a\r\npotential denial of service attack.\r\n\r\nThe function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by\r\nOpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this\r\nfunction directly and they use it on certificates that may have been\r\nobtained from untrusted sources.\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-23841\r\n\r\nReviewed-by: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>\r\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <pauli@openssl.org>\r\n(cherry picked from commit 8130d654d1de922ea224fa18ee3bc7262edc39c0)\r\n\r\n* Test that X509_issuer_and_serial_hash doesn't crash\r\n\r\nProvide a certificate with a bad issuer and check that\r\nX509_issuer_and_serial_hash doesn't crash.\r\n\r\nReviewed-by: Richard Levitte <levitte@openssl.org>\r\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <pauli@openssl.org>\r\n(cherry picked from commit 55869f594f052561b11a2db6a7c42690051868de)\r\n\r\n* Refactor rsa_test\r\n\r\nReduce code copying by factoring out common code into a separate function.\r\n\r\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <pauli@openssl.org>\r\n\r\n* Fix the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding type\r\n\r\nThis also fixes the public function RSA_padding_check_SSLv23.\r\n\r\nCommit 6555a89 changed the padding check logic in RSA_padding_check_SSLv23\r\nso that padding is rejected if the nul delimiter byte is not immediately\r\npreceded by at least 8 bytes containing 0x03. Prior to that commit the\r\npadding is rejected if it *is* preceded by at least 8 bytes containing 0x03.\r\n\r\nPresumably this change was made to be consistent with what it says in\r\nappendix E.3 of RFC 5246. Unfortunately that RFC is in error, and the\r\noriginal behaviour was correct. This is fixed in later errata issued for\r\nthat RFC.\r\n\r\nThis has no impact on libssl for modern versions of OpenSSL because\r\nthere is no protocol support for SSLv2 in these versions. However\r\napplications that call RSA_paddin_check_SSLv23 directly, or use the\r\nRSA_SSLV23_PADDING mode may still be impacted. The effect of the original\r\nerror is that an RSA message encrypted by an SSLv2 only client will fail to\r\nbe decrypted properly by a TLS capable server, or a message encrypted by a\r\nTLS capable client will fail to decrypt on an SSLv2 only server. Most\r\nsignificantly an RSA message encrypted by a TLS capable client will be\r\nsuccessfully decrypted by a TLS capable server. This last case should fail\r\ndue to a rollback being detected.\r\n\r\nThanks to D.
