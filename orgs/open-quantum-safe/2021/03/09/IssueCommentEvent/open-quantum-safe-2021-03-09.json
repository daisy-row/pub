Whatever: After replacing `gcc` with `cl` (and installing a suitable JDK (minimum 10)), maven started to operate OK, but didn't want to link the DLL. Main problem seems to be the configuration `pom.xml`: After setting `cl` as compiler this was the command executed by maven:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] cmd.exe /X /C \"cl -Ic:\\Users\\Administrator\\jdk-10/include -Ic:\\Users\\Administrator\\jdk-10/include/win32 -Ic:\\Users\\Administrator\\git\\liboqs\\build\\include -IC:\\Users\\Administrator\\git\\liboqs-java\\src\\main\\c -IC:\\Users\\Administrator\\git\\liboqs-java\\target\\generated-sources\\annotations -o C:\\Users\\Administrator\\git\\liboqs-java\\target\\objs\\Signature.obj -c C:\\Users\\Administrator\\git\\liboqs-java\\src\\main\\c\\Signature.c\"\r\nMicrosoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.28.29910 for x64\r\nSignature.c\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

In that case we can just keep it out of CircleCI, but all the other review comments still stand, with the exception that this can remain in `oqs_scripts` (and renamed to just `test_with_interop_server.py` or something). We can also rename `oqs_try_handshake.py` to `oqs_scripts/try_handshake.py`.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-09T17:06:03Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
