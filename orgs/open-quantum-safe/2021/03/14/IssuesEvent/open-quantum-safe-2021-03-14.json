I generated a key-pair and a certificate using the following classical, post-quantum, and hybrid algorithms. I got the following times and I couldn’t understand the reason behind slower key-pair generation/certificate generation times using hybrid algorithms.\r\n\r\nKey Generation\r\nClassical:\r\nRSA 3072 : 351.64 ms\r\nP256 : 3.7 ms\r\n\r\nPost-Quantum:\r\nDilithium 2 : 3.07 ms\r\n\r\nHybrids:\r\nRSA 3072-Dilithium2 : 263 ms (shouldn’t this be more than 351.64 ms?)\r\nP256-Dilihthium 2 : 3.21 ms (shouldn’t this be more than 3.7 ms?)\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that hybrid algorithms generate both keys/signatures and concatenate them in the certification process. If that is the case, key-pair/certificate generation time at a minimum should be the maximum key-pair/certificate generation times of individual algorithms. For example, algorithms A and B form a hybrid algorithm C. C should take a longer time than max(A,B) to generate key-pair/certificates. Is this correct?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-14T00:21:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
