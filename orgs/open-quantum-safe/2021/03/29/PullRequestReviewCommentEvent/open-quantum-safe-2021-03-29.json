All KEM/hybrid KEM logic is now in oqs_kem.c. There are internal functions for OQS KEMs (`oqs_qs_kem..`) and for EVP-based KEMs (`oqs_evp_kem..`). Then there are \"hybrid\" functions that combine the two mentioned types.\r\nOQSX_KEY now holds pointers to pointers to different subkeys (`void **privkey_ptr`, `void **pubkey_ptr`). In the usual KEM case, there is only one. In the hybrid case there are two. If there is a need for further keys (e.g. for hybrids with more than 2 schemes), this will be easy to add.\r\nAs you suggested, I also refactored the structs holding the OQS and EVP contexts. Previously they were in OQS_PRIMITIVE. Now there is `OQSX_PROVIDER_CTX` that holds the OQS_KEM/OQS_SIG and the EVP contexts.\r\nHypotetically, OQSX_PROVIDER_CTX could be extended with further context types (e.g. for using other OSSL API).","created_at":"2021-03-29T19:08:00Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T19:08:00Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16#discussion_r603543846","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/603543846"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16#discussion_r603543846"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":null,"original_line":82,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":602321715},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16","id":593994623,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkzOTk0NjIz","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/16","number":16,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Hybrid KEM support","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Hybrid KEM support for the oqs-provider (#3):\r\n- Combines OQS KEMs with OpenSSL EC-kex\r\n- Uses EVP API for OpenSSL EC-kex\r\n- Wraps hybrid KEM in OpenSSL3 KEM-API\r\n- Extends oqsx.h structures to accomodate KEM and KEX contexts\r\n- Refactoring to use preprocessor for hybrid combinations\r\n- Refactors oqs_test_groups: test iterates over all tls-groups in the oqs-provider\r\n- OQS/ECP and OQS/ECX hybrids\r\n- Updated fragments\r\n- Added generate-extras.yml with `nid_ecx_hybrid` code points.
