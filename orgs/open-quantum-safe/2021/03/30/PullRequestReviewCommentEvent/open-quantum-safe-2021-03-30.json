this would be useful, something more generic like this was also my initial idea when adding the keyslots. The main obstacle right now is that secret and ciphertext lengths are attached to source-specific structs (i.e. OQS_KEM/OQS_SIG vs the custom structs I've added for EVP). If this can be unified (e.g.  by queries to the new provider API), your suggested approach should be doable.","created_at":"2021-03-30T09:44:10Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T09:44:10Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16#discussion_r603945308","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments/603945308"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16#discussion_r603945308"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":290,"original_line":290,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":603791750},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/16","id":593994623,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkzOTk0NjIz","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/16","number":16,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Hybrid KEM support","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Hybrid KEM support for the oqs-provider (#3):\r\n- Combines OQS KEMs with OpenSSL EC-kex\r\n- Uses EVP API for OpenSSL EC-kex\r\n- Wraps hybrid KEM in OpenSSL3 KEM-API\r\n- Extends oqsx.h structures to accomodate KEM and KEX contexts\r\n- Refactoring to use preprocessor for hybrid combinations\r\n- Refactors oqs_test_groups: test iterates over all tls-groups in the oqs-provider\r\n- OQS/ECP and OQS/ECX hybrids\r\n- Updated fragments\r\n- Added generate-extras.yml with `nid_ecx_hybrid` code points.
