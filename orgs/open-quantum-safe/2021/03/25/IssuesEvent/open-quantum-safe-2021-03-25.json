I open an issue here because it also affects interop with OSSL1.1.1.\r\n\r\n- Interop with previous-round algorithms\r\n\r\nLooking at the google sheets, some of the algorithm names still refer to round 2 variants:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12YarzaNv3XQNLnvDsWLlRKwtZFhRrDdWf36YlzwrPeg/edit#gid=0\r\nIn the meanwhile, the algorithms were updated to r3 while keeping the same code points. \r\nI imagine that this can cause confusion, similar to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/909, when trying to interop between different libraries or between different versions of OQS.\r\nDo we want to consider to update the code points after future algorithm updates?\r\n\r\n- Hybrid KEM code points with ECX (X25519, X448)\r\n\r\nI'm adding support for combining all OQS KEM with ECX and ECP curves in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16. The `generate.yml` file currently only defines code points for ECP-hybrids. Looking at https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-01#section-3.1, the hybrid code points should fit in `0x2F00 .. 0x2FFF`. An option is to add the ECX-hybrids with a `0x40` offset to `0x2F..` (except for those three hybrid algorithms already defined with X25519). For example, a field in generate.yml would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    family: 'FrodoKEM'\r\n    name_group: 'frodo640aes'\r\n    nid: '0x0200'\r\n    nid_hybrid: '0x2F00'\r\n    nid_ecx_hybrid: '0x2F40'\r\n    oqs_alg: 'OQS_KEM_alg_frodokem_640_aes'\r\n    bit_security: 128\r\n```\r\nThe OSSL3 provider currently imports generate.yml from the OSSL1.1.1 repository. If you agree, I'd open a PR here with new code points for ECX-hybrids (and the google sheets can be updated). OSSL1.1.1 doesn't necessarily need to support the additional ECX-hybrid code points.\r\n\r\n- Strength matching X448\r\n\r\nX448 with 224 bit security sits between NIST L3/L4 and L5. The initial attempt in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/16 is to match PQC L3-L5 with X448, being aware that this is not an \"exact\" match. Are there any thoughts about this and if/how we should support hybrids with X448?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-25T09:52:38Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
