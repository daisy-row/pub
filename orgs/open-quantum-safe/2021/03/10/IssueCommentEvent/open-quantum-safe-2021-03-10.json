This interface does not require AVX2 instructions. It accepts any implementation of \"Keccak1600P-times4\" from the XKCP low-level interface, and it quietly falls back to a serial implementation using whatever (possibly platform optimized) implementation of Keccak1600P is available. A serial implementation is also used when OpenSSL is enabled.\r\n* Scripted the importing/patching of implementations of the low-level XKCP interface. (scripts will be submitted in a followup commit or pr). The implementations are made available in src/common/sha3/xkcp_low and a suitable implementation is chosen at compile time by src/common/sha3/xkcp_low/CMakeLists.txt.\r\n* Replaced fips202.c, sha3_c.c, and sha3_avx.c with xkcp_sha3.c, which implements sha3.h using the low-level XKCP interface.\r\n* Replaced sha3_x4.c, and sha3x4_avx2.c with xkcp_sha3x4.c, which implements sha3x4.h using the low-level XKCP interface.\r\n* Added ossl_sha3.c and ossl_sha3x4.c which implement sha3.h and sha3x4, including the incremental APIs (#502), using openssl.\r\n* Removed (unused) cshake functions.\r\n* Removed non-incremental shake functions like OQS_SHA3_shake128_absorb, but keep simple shake functions like OQS_SHA3_shake128.\r\n* Added \"sha3_*_ctx_reset\" which re-initializes an already allocated context.\r\n* Changed OQS_SHA3_sha3_*_inc_finalize so that it does not free the context. This allows you to re-use a context with \"reset\".\r\n* Removed Picnic's duplicate sha3 code\r\n* Added a patching mechanism to copy_from_upstream\r\n* Removed SPHINCS's duplicate sha3 code (with copy_from_upstream patch)\r\n* Removed Kyber's duplicate sha3 code (with copy_from_upstream patch)\r\n* Removed Dilithium's duplicate sha3 code (with copy_from_upstream patch)\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n* OpenSSL does not implement a proper \"squeeze\" function. There's work in progress to fix this (https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/7921), but we should not expect it to be available anytime soon. The implementation of the incremental API that I've written is quadratic in the total output length if O(1) bytes are squeezed at a time. This leads to a severe loss of performance for Falcon, so this PR currently turns off OQS_USE_SHA3_OPENSSL even when OQS_USE_OPENSSL is on.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* Import optimized Keccak routines for other architectures and select appropriately at compile time. There are several ARM implementations available. There's also AVX512.\r\n* (Future work) Compile multiple Keccak implementations and select an appropriate one at runtime for \"portable\" builds. \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/796207141","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/922#issuecomment-796207141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/922","id":796207141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NjIwNzE0MQ==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-10T22:09:53Z","updated_at":"2021-03-10T22:09:53Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I asked the Picnic team to review this PR.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-10T22:09:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
