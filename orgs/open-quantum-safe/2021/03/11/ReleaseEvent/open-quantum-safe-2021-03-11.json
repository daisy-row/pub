It was released on March 10, 2021.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.4.0 release of liboqs.  Its main goal is to incorporate updates submitted to Round 3 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n\r\nAs a result of NIST's announcement of Round 3 of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, the 0.4.x series was the last release of liboqs to contain algorithms from Round 2 that are not Round 3 finalists or alternate candidates.  Those algorithms have been removed in the 0.5.0 series.  The algorithms in question are: NewHope, ThreeBears, MQDSS, and qTesla.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- BIKE: No changes.\r\n- Classic McEliece: Added AVX2 implementation.\r\n- FrodoKEM: Incorporate upstream bug fixes and add runtime CPU feature detection for AVX2/AES-NI implementation.\r\n- HQC: Update to Round 3 version.\r\n- Kyber: Update to Round 3 version.\r\n- NTRU: Incorporate upstream bug fixes.\r\n- NTRUPrime: Add NTRUPrime.\r\n- Saber: Update to Round 3 version.\r\n- SIKE: Update to version 3.4.\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Dilithium: Update to version 3.1.\r\n- Falcon: Update to Round 3 version.\r\n- Picnic: Update to Picnic v3.0.4.\r\n- Rainbow: Update to Round 3 version.\r\n- SPHINCS+: Incorporate upstream bug fixes.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Support for building liboqs with CPU extensions has been enhanced, and most implementations now have runtime CPU feature detection.\r\n- A tool for benchmarking memory usage has been added (`test_kem_mem` and `test_sig_mem`).\r\n- Valgrind is used to check for secret-dependent branch throughout the library. Note that not all implementations currently avoid secret-dependent branching; see `tests/constant_time` for details.\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-11T13:40:59Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
