To answer your question \"_Why do you need both platforms?_\" my main platform is **Java on Windows 10 x64** and your code in Common.java suggests that I do need a platform specific library (oqs-jni.dll) for this. On the other hand I'm running an **Online compiler service** (https://repl.it/) to present my codes in a running environment that has Linux as its OS, so my thoughts are that I do need a second library (liboqs-jni.so). If one library is all that I need - that would be okay for me :-).\r\n\r\nRegarding your recommendation for a build process: I do not have an Ubuntu-OS running on my machine, so I am not able to run the build process as described on https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java.\r\n\r\n\"_Could you share information what you want to achieve ultimately?_\": Of course, I'm running a private project \"Cross platform cryptography\" on GitHub (https://java-crypto.github.io/cross_platform_crypto/ or https://github.com/java-crypto/cross_platform_crypto) and actually I'm trying to show programs that can handle post quantum cryptography. I found liboqs as it has implementations of all round 3 candidates. That brought me to my initial question that I do need a compiled version of this library to run Java (and other framework) examples.\r\n\r\nAre there any concerns to simply provide the compiled library (as attachment, mail or...) ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your kindly help and greetings to lovely Switzerland\r\nMichael","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-08T09:42:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Hence our recommendation for using docker images that take care of such problems, particularly cross-platform ones -- actually by way of a common platform (Alpine, presently only x86_64, but arm64 is just around the corner). Please check out the proposal above and let me know whether it could serve your purpose: It seems we have similar goals: Making PQC easily accessible. I am afraid, reading your website that some work on your side, particularly compiling code, e.g. for maximum performance, would be advisable. Side note: You also may want to consider using LetsEncrypt certificates for [your website](https://javacrypto.bplaced.net/) as the self-signed cert there may make paranoid people nervous :-)","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-03-08T09:54:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
