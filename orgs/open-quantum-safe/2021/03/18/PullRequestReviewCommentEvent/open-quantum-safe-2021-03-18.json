Both `KEY_TYPE_ECP_HYB_KEM` and `KEY_TYPE_ECX_HYB_KEM` refer to the same code.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid implementation choses the classical scheme (ecp/ecx) implicitly using as input (1) a variable that determines which family to chose (ecp/ecx) and (2) the NIST security level of the pqc KEM. That way code is a bit more compact and avoids having to iterate through each individual combination. So the two different hybrid types are because of (1).\r\n\r\nA third type would be necessary when combining with
