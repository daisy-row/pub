Or is the logic of requiring digesting so deeply embedded in the OpenSSL (X509) logic that our provider better have its own (\"do nothing\") digest and register that via `OSSL_FUNC_core_obj_add_sigid`?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/936308396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-10-06T14:10:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
