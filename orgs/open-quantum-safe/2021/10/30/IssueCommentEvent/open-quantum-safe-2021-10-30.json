Reasons: 1) The [patch](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/test/ssltestlib.c.patch) to retrofit provider testing into the current openssl(3) master test suite can (and did) break without notice. 2) CI systems anyway always need to build openssl(3) as it is not a system default. 3) This approach enables a more powerful test suite than otherwise doable (without lots of re-inventing the proverbial wheel, i.e., code duplication).\r\n-> Let me know if you are opposed to this approach and want `oqsprovider` to be fully self-contained either by [raising an issue](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues) or commenting on this thread. I otherwise merge in a day or two.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/955402804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-10-30T16:11:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
