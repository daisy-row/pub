Thoughts on the issue above also very welcome.\r\n\r\nWell, my first question is, why do you want to implement EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo -\\> PrivateKeyInfo decoding?  There is already a decoder that does this explicitly in OpenSSL.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's really nothing magic about our internal pw functions, they should be easy to replicate...  something like this would do:\r\n\r\n``` C\r\nstruct key2any_ctx_st {\r\n    PROV_OQS_CTX *provctx;\r\n\r\n    /* Set to 0 if parameters should not be saved (dsa only) */\r\n    int save_parameters;\r\n\r\n    /* Set to 1 if intending to encrypt/decrypt, otherwise 0 */\r\n    int cipher_intent;\r\n\r\n    EVP_CIPHER *cipher;\r\n\r\n    OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK *pwcb;\r\n    void *pwcbarg;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` C\r\n// A passphrase wrapper\r\nint get_passphrase(char *pass, size_t pass_size, size_t *pass_len, struct key2any_ctx_st *ctx)\r\n{\r\n    return ctx->pwcb(pass, pass_size, pass_len, NULL, ctx->pwcbarg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen use this wrapper instead of `ossl_pw_get_passphrase()`, and replace the call of `ossl_pw_set_ossl_passphrase_cb()` with this:\r\n\r\n``` C\r\n    ctx->pwcb = pwcb;\r\n    ctx->pwcbarg = pwcbarg;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's really not much more to it.\r\n\r\nThe reason that OpenSSL has the set of `ossl_pw` function is primarily because we have a total of three methods to get a passphrase: `pem_password_cb`, UI methods, and now `OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK`.  The `ossl_pw` functionality is an attempt to gateway between all those methods through a common interface.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/934356263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-10-05T12:17:42Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
