I'm not sure about FrodoKEM or SABER. \r\n\r\nI also agree that we should create new algorithm ID's for each new round that doesn't have backwards compatibility. AWS has already released client SDK's that can negotiate Round 2 versions of BIKE, SIKE, and Kyber. We don't want to break those clients by changing the algorithm ID's to mean the Round 3 variants on the server side, while the clients that haven't migrated yet still think those ID's mean Round 2. \r\n\r\nSince Kyber Round 3 is not backwards compatible with Round 2, this means that the changes in this pull request for Kyber at least are applicable, and should be applied. `0x2F0F` meant `secp256r1_kyber-512-r2` according to the previous spreadsheet, while this table now indicates that it means `secp256r1_kyber-512-r3`. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if FrodoKEM or SABER are cross compatible between their Round 2 and Round 3 versions, so I'm not certain if we can reuse their Round 2 ID's for Round 3.
