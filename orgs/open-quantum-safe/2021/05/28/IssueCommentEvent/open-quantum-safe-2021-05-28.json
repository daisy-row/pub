These ID's have not been merged into s2n yet, and we wanted to make sure that both OQS and s2n agree on the new ID's that we're proposing before merging them into s2n. We have been treating the spreadsheet as the source of truth and originally attempted to add them there, but were redirected to this markdown table.
