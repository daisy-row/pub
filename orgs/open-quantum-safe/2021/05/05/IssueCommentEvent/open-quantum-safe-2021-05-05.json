The same thing would have to happen with signature algorithms.  OpenSSL would have to do a capabilities query for signatures and it would pass the name of a signature algorithm and then the  provider would respond with the code point that corresponds to that name if it supports that algorithm.\r\n\r\nHopefully, this makes things clearer?
