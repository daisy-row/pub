To the contrary we spent a lot of effort to make things as easy as possible to consume (e.g., doing [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=openquantumsafe&type=image)) for people with less time and interest to dive into all details of PQ/QS crypto.\r\n\r\nYou are pointing out a relevant shortcoming that I only now realized myself: The OpenSSL provider had been part of the OpenSSL fork _and_ is *not* properly documented at the project overview at https://openquantumsafe.org (in particular [the part on TLS](https://openquantumsafe.org/applications/tls/)). We'll fix this. \r\n\r\nAs the various OQS subprojects further may have non-obvious interdependencies for the initial user it probably is a good idea to provide additional pointers from the github READMEs to [the project overview site](https://openquantumsafe.org) to explain those to the \"unwary\".
