For `implementation_type`, there are at the moment values for \"Plain C\" (Rainbow) and \"optimized\" (Dilithium, HQC, Frodo).\r\n> The NIST submissions contain \"reference\", \"optimized\" and \"additional\" implementations, where both \"reference\" and \"optimized\" implementations need to be plain portable C. Additional implementations can be assembly-optimized. Would it be clearer to have \"reference (plain C)\", \"optimized (plain C)\" and \"assembly-optimized\" as possible values for `implementation_type`?\r\n> \r\n\r\nMy aim here was that these would just be (possibly opaque) identifiers that just make it possible to look up what \"flavor\" we pulled from the upstream code (if the upstream has three implementations `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, we'd also just note down `X` or `Y` or `Z` in the YAML file).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The Frodo yml lists macOS and Windows as target platforms for armel and armhf. Isn't it just Linux (or perhaps macOS because of M1)?\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/46cc3089c9f3e6140d5d8446886f3a67abb34045/docs/algorithms/kem/frodokem.yml#L40\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/46cc3089c9f3e6140d5d8446886f3a67abb34045/docs/algorithms/kem/frodokem.yml#L52\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> The Frodo yml lists \"armel\" as not portable. Is this correct?\r\n\r\nI did not check whether the values were correct, just copy-pasted to hash out what the general YAML file would look like.\r\n\r\n> > If you'd want me to extend the YAML->MD converter, please let me know where that code is (@xvzcf ? Didn't find it in `scripts` or `doc`).\r\n> \r\n> There is some code to partially generate the .md files after copy_from_upstream: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/scripts/copy_from_upstream/docs/algorithms. This should be obsolete after completing this here, but it could serve as a template for generating .md files from the new yml-files.\r\n\r\nI'll paste the quick-and-dirty script I wrote to generate the markdown files in a separate comment. I think we'll have to ensure consistency between the information in these new YAML files and, for example, [copy_from_upstream.yml](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/scripts/copy_from_upstream/copy_from_upstream.yml) (such as making sure the `pretty_name_full`s line up); we could automatically populate some of the fields in the new files using `copy_from_upstream.yml` and whatever else is there (the suppression files?), but this is probably best set aside for a future issue/PR.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-05-03T14:29:28Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
