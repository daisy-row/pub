It includes a client ``ssh`` and server ``sshd``, file transfer utilities ``scp`` and ``sftp`` as well as tools for key generation (``ssh-keygen``), run-time key storage (``ssh-agent``) and a number of supporting programs.\n+[OpenSSH](https://openssh.org/) is an open-source implementation of the Secure Shell protocol.  ([View the original README](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/blob/OQS-master/README.original.md).)\n \n-This is a port of OpenBSD's [OpenSSH](https://openssh.com) to most Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, OS X and Cygwin. Portable OpenSSH polyfills OpenBSD APIs that are not available elsewhere, adds sshd sandboxing for more operating systems and includes support for OS-native authentication and auditing (e.g. using PAM).\n+OQS-OpenSSH is a fork of OpenSSH that adds quantum-safe key exchange and signature algorithms using [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) for prototyping and evaluation purposes. This fork is not endorsed by the OpenSSH project.\n \n-## Documentation\n+- [Overview](#overview)\n+- [Status](#status)\n+  * [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security)\n+  * [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms)\n+- [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n+  * [Building OQS-OpenSSH](#building-oqs-openssh)\n+  * [Running OQS-OpenSSH](#running-oqs-openssh)\n+- [Contributing](#contributing)\n+- [License](#license)\n+- [Team](#team)\n+- [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)\n \n-The official documentation for OpenSSH are the man pages for each tool:\n+## Overview\n \n-* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)\n-* [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)\n-* [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1)\n-* [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)\n-* [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1)\n-* [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1)\n-* [ssh-keyscan(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.8)\n-* [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8)\n+**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

We recommend the use of a stable release for most users. Please read the [release notes](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) for details of recent changes and potential incompatibilities.\n+Both liboqs and this fork are part of the **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project**, which aims to develop and prototype quantum-safe cryptography. More information about the project can be found [here](https://openquantumsafe.org/).\n \n-## Building Portable OpenSSH\n+## Status\n \n-### Dependencies\n+This fork is currently based on OpenSSH version **8.4** (Git tag V_8_4_P1); release notes can be found [here](RELEASE.md). **IT IS AT AN EXPERIMENTAL STAGE**, and has not received the same level of auditing and analysis that OpenSSH has received. See the [Limitations and Security](#limitations-and-security) section below for more information.\n \n-Portable OpenSSH is built using autoconf and make. It requires a working C compiler, standard library and headers, and [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/). ``libcrypto`` from either [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) or [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) may also be used, but OpenSSH may be built without it supporting a subset of crypto algorithms.\n+**WE DO NOT RECOMMEND RELYING ON THIS FORK TO PROTECT SENSITIVE DATA.**\n \n-FIDO security token support need [libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2) and its dependencies. Also, certain platforms and build-time options may require additional dependencies, see README.platform for details.\n+liboqs is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind.  See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.\n \n-### Building a release\n+This fork implements the [draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kampanakis-curdle-pq-ssh/) IETF draft for hybrid key exchange algorithms.\n \n-Releases include a pre-built copy of the ``configure`` script and may be built using:\n+### Limitations and security\n+\n+As research advances, the supported algorithms may see rapid changes in their security, and may even prove insecure against both classical and quantum computers.\n+\n+We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms, and strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying quantum-safe cryptography.\n+\n+While at the time of this writing there are no vulnerabilities known in any of the quantum-safe algorithms used in this fork, it is advisable to wait on deploying quantum-safe algorithms until further guidance is provided by the standards community, especially from the NIST standardization project.\n+\n+We realize some parties may want to deploy quantum-safe cryptography prior to the conclusion of the standardization project.  We strongly recommend such attempts make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography. This fork provides the ability to use hybrid cryptography.\n+\n+### Supported Algorithms\n+\n+If an algorithm is provided by liboqs but is not listed below, it can still be used in the fork through [either one of two ways](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/wiki/Using-liboqs-supported-algorithms-in-the-fork).\n+\n+#### Key Exchange\n+\n+The following quantum-safe algorithms from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):\n+\n+- `oqs-default-sha256` (see [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/wiki/Using-liboqs-supported-algorithms-in-the-fork) for what this denotes)\n+<!--- OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_LIST_ALL_KEXS_START -->\n+- **FrodoKEM**: `frodokem-640-aes-sha256`, `frodokem-976-aes-sha384`, `frodokem-1344-aes-sha512`\n+- **SIKE**: `sike-p434-sha256`\n+<!--- OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_LIST_ALL_KEXS_END -->\n+\n+For each `<KEX>` listed above, the following hybrid algorithms are made available as follows:\n+\n+- If `<KEX>` has L1 security, the method `ecdh-nistp256-<KEX>` is available, which combines `<KEX>` with ECDH using NIST's P256 curve\n+- If `<KEX>` has L3 security, the method `ecdh-nistp384-<KEX>` is available, which combines `<KEX>` with ECDH using NIST's P384 curve\n+- If `<KEX>` has L5 security, the method `ecdh-nistp521-<KEX>` is available, which combines `<KEX>` with ECDH using NIST's P521 curve\n+\n+Note that algorithms marked with a dagger (â€ ) have large stack usage and may cause failures when run on threads or in constrained environments.\n+\n+#### Digital Signature\n+\n+The following digital signature algorithms from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs). Note that only L1 signature and all **Rainbow** variants are enabled by default, and should you wish to enable additional variants, consult [the \"Code Generation\" section of the documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/wiki/Using-liboqs-supported-algorithms-in-the-for://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/wiki/Using-liboqs-supported-algorithms-in-the-fork#code-generation).\n+\n+- `oqsdefault` (see [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/wiki/Using-liboqs-supported-algorithms-in-the-fork) for what this denotes)\n+<!--- OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_LIST_ALL_SIGS_START -->\n+- **Dilithium**: `dilithium2`, `dilithium3`, `dilithium5`\n+<!--- OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT_LIST_ALL_SIGS_END -->\n+\n+The following hybrid algorithms are supported; they combine a quantum-safe algorithm listed above with a traditional digital signature algorithm (`<SIG>` is any one of the algorithms listed above):\n+\n+- if `<SIG>` has L1 security, then the fork provides the methods `rsa3072-<SIG>` and `ecdsa-nistp256-<SIG>`, which combine `<SIG>` with RSA3072 and with ECDSA using NIST's P256 curve respectively.\n+- if `<SIG>` has L3 security, the fork provides the method `ecdsa-nistp384-<SIG>`, which combines `<SIG>` with ECDSA using NIST's P384 curve.\n+- if `<SIG>` has L5 security, the fork provides the method `ecdsa-nistp521-<SIG>`, which combines `<SIG>` with ECDSA using NIST's P521 curve.\n+\n+## Quickstart\n+\n+The steps below have been confirmed to work on macOS 10.14 (clang 10.0.0) and Ubuntu 18.04.1 Bionic (gcc-7).\n+\n+### Building OQS-OpenSSH\n+\n+### Step 0: Install dependencies\n+\n+On **Ubuntu**, you need to install the following packages:\n+\n+\tsudo apt install autoconf automake cmake gcc libtool libssl-dev make ninja-build zlib1g-dev\n+\n+On **Linux**, you also may need to do the following:\n+\n+- You may need to create the privilege separation directory:\n+\n+\t\tsudo mkdir -p -m 0755 /var/empty\n+\n+- You may need to create the privilege separation user:\n+\n+\t\tsudo groupadd sshd\n+\t\tsudo useradd -g sshd -c 'sshd privsep' -d /var/empty -s /bin/false sshd\n+\n+On **macOS**, you need to install the following packages using brew (or a package manager of your choice):\n+\n+\tbrew install autoconf automake cmake libtool ninja openssl@1.1 wget\n+\n+### Step 1: Build and install liboqs\n+\n+The following instructions install liboqs into a subdirectory inside the OpenSSH source.

It includes a client ``ssh`` and server ``sshd``, file transfer utilities ``scp`` and ``sftp`` as well as tools for key generation (``ssh-keygen``), run-time key storage (``ssh-agent``) and a number of supporting programs.\n+\n+This is a port of OpenBSD's [OpenSSH](https://openssh.com) to most Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, OS X and Cygwin. Portable OpenSSH polyfills OpenBSD APIs that are not available elsewhere, adds sshd sandboxing for more operating systems and includes support for OS-native authentication and auditing (e.g. using PAM).\n+\n+## Documentation\n+\n+The official documentation for OpenSSH are the man pages for each tool:\n+\n+* [ssh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)\n+* [sshd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8)\n+* [ssh-keygen(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1)\n+* [ssh-agent(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1)\n+* [scp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1)\n+* [sftp(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1)\n+* [ssh-keyscan(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.8)\n+* [sftp-server(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8)\n+\n+## Stable Releases\n+\n+Stable release tarballs are available from a number of [download mirrors](https://www.openssh.com/portable.html#downloads). We recommend the use of a stable release for most users. Please read the [release notes](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) for details of recent changes and potential incompatibilities.\n+\n+## Building Portable OpenSSH\n+\n+### Dependencies\n+\n+Portable OpenSSH is built using autoconf and make. It requires a working C compiler, standard library and headers, and [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/). ``libcrypto`` from either [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) or [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) may also be used, but OpenSSH may be built without it supporting a subset of crypto algorithms.\n+\n+FIDO security token support need [libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2) and its dependencies. Also, certain platforms and build-time options may require additional dependencies, see README.platform for details.\n+\n+### Building a release\n+\n+Releases include a pre-built copy of the ``configure`` script and may be built using:\n+\n+```\n+tar zxvf openssh-X.YpZ.tar.gz\n+cd openssh\n+./configure # [options]\n+make && make tests\n+```\n+\n+See the [Build-time Customisation](#build-time-customisation) section below for configure options. If you plan on installing OpenSSH to your system, then you will usually want to specify destination paths.\n+ \n+### Building from git\n+\n+If building from git, you'll need [autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) installed to build the ``configure`` script. The following commands will check out and build portable OpenSSH from git:\n+\n+```\n+git clone https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable # or https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git\n+cd openssh-portable\n+autoreconf\n+./configure\n+make && make tests","path":"README.original.md","position":56,"original_position":56,"commit_id":"1cc0fdb173b6c67a2ed590b9083deb1db6b88d0d","original_commit_id":"1cc0fdb173b6c67a2ed590b9083deb1db6b88d0d","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"To me, that suggested the need for certificates, which is why I disabled it [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/openssh-8/oqs-test/run_tests.sh#L14).
