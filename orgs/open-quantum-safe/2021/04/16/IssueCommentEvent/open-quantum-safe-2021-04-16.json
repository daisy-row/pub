I have performed a couple of server client connections with rsa 3072 and falcon1024 with the following code:\r\nServer : {bssl_dir} server -cert rsa_crt.pem -key rsa_srv.pem -accept 44330 \r\nclient : echo \"X\" | {bssl_dir} client -connect 10.0.0.157:44330 -root-certs rsa_CA.pem\r\n\r\nServer : {bssl_dir} server -cert falcon1024_crt.pem -key falcon1024_srv.pem -accept 44330 \r\nclient : echo \"X\" | {bssl_dir} client -connect 10.0.0.157:44330 -root-certs falcon1024_CA.pem\r\n\r\nWith rsa, the client is able to verify the server with CA certificate but with the post quantum algorithms, it fails with the following error : \r\n\r\nerror on client side:\r\nConnecting to 10.0.0.157:44330\r\nError while connecting: UNKNOWN_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM\r\n94279995259064:error:0c0000b8:ASN.1 encoding

As far as I can tell, those are coming up in the Dilithium source code.

I can see calls to pqcrystals_fips202_ref_shake256_absorb` existing in the Dilithium source code, but I can't actually find anywhere that the symbol `pqcrystals_fips202_ref_shake256_absorb` is implemented, nor do I see a shim mapping `pqcrystals_fips202_ref_shake256_absorb` onto an OQS function, so I don't actually understand how it is that the build isn't failing.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-04-16T19:51:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
