Enables run-time CPU feature detection.\"\r\n* OQS_OPT_TARGET (default: \"auto\"): \"The target microarchitecture for optimization.\"\r\n\r\nOQS_DIST_BUILD is a drop in replacement for the previous OQS_PORTABLE_BUILD. A library built with OQS_DIST_BUILD will include implementations for several microarchitectures, and it will dispatch calls to the correct implementation based the CPU features that are available at run time. The OQS_DIST_BUILD option is refined to one of OQS_DIST_X86_64_BUILD, OQS_DIST_ARM64v8_BUILD, or OQS_DIST_ARM32v7_BUILD at compile time depending on CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR. This is useful for cross compiling and it also simplifies some logic throughout the build.\r\n\r\nOQS_OPT_TARGET can take a value of \"auto\", \"generic\", or the name of a CPU like \"haswell\". When OQS_DIST_BUILD=ON we force OQS_OPT_TARGET=generic.\r\n\r\nOn x86_64, \"generic\" means we'll compile with \"-march=x86-64\". On ARM64v8 \"generic\" means \"-mcpu=cortex-a53\". On ARM32v7 \"generic\" means \"-mcpu=cortex-a5\". This is like OQS_USE_CPU_EXTENSIONS=OFF.\r\n\r\nOn any architecture, \"auto\" will try to determine the current CPU using \"march=native\" (if it's supported). This is like the previous OQS_USE_CPU_EXTENSIONS=ON\r\n\r\nDownstream builds that set OQS_PORTABLE_BUILD or OQS_USE_CPU_FEATURES will fail. So we should prepare for that if we decide to make these changes.\r\n\r\n*edit*: Removing OQS_USE_CPU_EXTENSIONS had the side effect that our ARM jobs tried to execute detect_gcc_clang_intrinsics.c. I took the opportunity to add both compile-time detection of ARM crypto features and neon. It is now possible to cross compile for ARM and optimize for the target CPU (relevant to #775). I also took the opportunity to add run-time detection of ARM features, and I replaced OQS_get_available_CPU_extensions (01efe50) for efficiency reasons (previous implementation was copying ~40 bytes on return).","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/813992420","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/951#issuecomment-813992420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/951","id":813992420,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzk5MjQyMA==","user":{"login":"thomwiggers","id":974662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NDY2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/974662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers","html_url":"https://github.com/thomwiggers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-06T09:56:20Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T09:56:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`OQS_DIST_BUILD (default: OFF)` — this is a change from the previously-default-on `OQS_PORTABLE_BUILD` right?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-04-06T09:56:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

all code is designed such that it can not only be configured at compile time to deal with different CPU feature sets (e.g., presence/absence of AVX2) but also handle those gracefully at runtime, e.g, by automatically falling back to a non-optimised version of the same functionality.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all code compiled with, e.g., `-mavx2` should also run without error on CPUs that do *not* have support for all features (AVX2 in this example).\r\n\r\nTo help with this, we will integrate the [CPU features](https://github.com/google/cpu_features) library and for starters will add warnings if the library is running on a CPU with a feature set different from the one encountered during build (reducing the surprise when one encounters an `illegal instruction exception` during execution
