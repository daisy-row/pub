Following it a few steps, I felt like falling into [Alice's rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland), finding lots of \"wondrous things\", e.g., many wrappers (of Java code to native and vice versa, apparently) working around various JDK shortcomings (ALPN, etc.)....\r\n\r\nTo cut things short, is my understanding right that you basically want to add PQC to [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), i.e., [Java EE/Jakarta](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jakartaee-platform/)? If so, I'd see two options for you:\r\n1) Do it \"right\", i.e., enable PQC through the API stack, allowing you to switch and select PQ algorithms at all steps (signature/certificates, key selection/exchange, etc.). This option means complete dependence on the \"IP owners\" Oracle and Eclipse to get the APIs in place -> As already stated above, wait a few years and/or get in contact with those folks.\r\n2) Do a \"simple proof-of-concept\", i.e., enable \"under the hood\" PQC for key exchange? That may well be doable now if you'd have full control over the openssl-shared library/DLL used in both client- and server-side components in your application deployment. Ideal would be the API option to pass a string via API to select the TLS1.3 KEM group (i.e., PQ algorithm), but even without that, you could set that statically in both client- and server-side (oqs-)openssl libraries (forcing the exclusive use of quantum safe crypto for key exchange).\r\n--> You'd need to decide what you want to achieve (and in which time frame) and what infrastructure you can/have deployed: I'd be glad to assist with getting option 2 above going, but cannot really help with any \"Java stuff\": My experience on that is seriously dated (15+ years, to be precise :-)","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-04-29T06:47:50Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

I have already signed up for the OpenSSL Contributors Agreement since we wanted to make 2 minor contributions to the OpenSSL code base: \r\n\r\n- 0a8e6c1fb77612feba350a67dad3e548300785a7\r\n- 2555285fa5e4248ad4a5a0bc14ae4606443856c2\r\n\r\nIt likely comes as no surprise to you that we are implementing our own closed source provider.  I am actually currently looking into #2, but for our provider.  Of course, our provider will be different from oqs-proivder's internals.  As such, the code that I will have will be distinctly different than what you will need and will obviously not patch in cleanly. However,  I would be happy to give pointers, helpful hints and warnings about potential dead ends. For example, you won't need to write encoder import methods because there are no other implementations of these algorithms to import from.  When I first started looking at the provider encoder documentation I spent a lot of time trying to figure what I needed to  do for the encoder's import API and finally figured out that it was not necessary. Hopefully, I've prevented you from wasting that time like I did.

It does not help that encode_key2any.c is hard to read (for  me) due to macro defines. \r\nI started with text encoder because it seemed simpler.
