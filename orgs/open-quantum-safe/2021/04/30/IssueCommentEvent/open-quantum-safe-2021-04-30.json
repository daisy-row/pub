Would you want to do that as part of a PR to update [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md)? Are you using this DLL to handle https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/issues/36 (i.e., are cross-building the Windows-DLL for the python wrapper and not build it on Windows natively)? May this explain the naming issue there?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-04-30T09:27:54Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
