Proposals for classifying the tests as well as how to implement them, too.\r\n\r\n@dstebila @xvzcf @jschanck @christianpaquin (any one else not party to the conversation up to now as well, of course) please click \"+1\" if you agree we should tackle this problem and if you have more time, additional feedback/suggestions would be great.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-04-23T14:32:53Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
