looked at the AES C implementation in PQClean and it looks like it would mostly fit in with what we need, except that our API includes ECB decryption operations, whereas the implementation in PQClean doesn't provide that.  However, as far as I can tell, the only place we call decryption is in the AES test harness (to see if decryption successfully decrypts encryption).  We have other known-answer tests for AES encryption in our test harness, so I think it would be okay to drop the decryption operations from our API.
