Anything concrete we could help with? I personally wonder whether it might not be better to do \"real\" testing on a dedicated network (e.g., using a cloud VPN or possibly better, comprising two notebooks with a wire between them) to arrive at \"reproducible\" or numbers explicable by the oqs/openssl code and no other network traffic.\r\n@xvzcf might have input regarding your final question: Again, personally I have no experience with `veth` (let alone how to use it with \"real\" outgoing traffic).","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-06-16T05:25:21Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

If the former, keeping numbers contiguous (i.e., change whole \"number blocks\" for algorithms with different R2+R3 KATs) would seem sensible, but requiring a change in pq-s2n.

Or shall we decide that \"by program\", e.g., adding a hash of an algorithm's KATs to the [openssl-generate.yml](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/oqs-template/generate.yml) to always be made aware of the need to update code points in the future? If the latter, does someone have a better idea than adding & checking [liboqs' (current) KATs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commits/main/tests/KATs/kem/kats.json) when running `generate.py`?\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-06-16T07:05:47Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
