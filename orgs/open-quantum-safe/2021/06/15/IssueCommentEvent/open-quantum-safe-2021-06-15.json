The old algorithms, BIKE1-{L1,L3}-{CPA,FO}, are from the previous round. I did not remove them as I didn't know if they are still needed for backward compatibility. Should I remove them?\r\n> \r\n> If they're no longer part of the BIKE submission, then I'd remove them. We don't make a promise to keep support for old versions of algorithms.\r\n\r\nOk, no problem.
