It will automatically be detected if it is under `/usr` or another standard location.  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n \n ### Step 2: Build the fork\n \n-In `<OPENSSH_ROOT>`, first run:\n+Run the following:\n \n ```\n-export OPENSSH_INSTALL=<path-to-install-openssh>\n-autoreconf\n+env OPENSSL_SYS_DIR=<PATH_TO_OPENSSL> ./oqs-scripts/build_openssh.sh\n ```\n \n-Then, run the following:\n-\n-\t./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path-to-openssl>/include \\\n-\t            --with-ldflags=-L<path-to-openssl>/lib   \\\n-\t            --with-libs=-lm                          \\\n-\t            --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL                \\\n-\t            --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL            \\\n-\t            --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs\n-\tmake \n-\tmake install\n+`OPENSSL_SYS_DIR` does not have to be specified if OpenSSL is present under `usr/`.\n \n-Again, the `path-to-openssl` (1.1.1) does not need to be specified if it is in one of the standard locations.\n+As not all tests in the stock regression suite pass, run `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n \n-So, in summary, if OpenSSL is installed in a default location and `oqs-openssh` is to be installed in `/opt/openssh` this command builds and installs `oqs-openssh`: `export OPENSSH_INSTALL=/opt/openssh && autoreconf && ./configure --with-libs=-lm --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs && make && make install`\n-\n-As not all stock `openssh` tests are passing, be sure to execute `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n-\n-To execute a connection test with one of the supported quantum-safe algorithms (chosen at random), run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If all algorithms should be exercized, pass a parameter to this command, e.g., like this: `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n+To execute a connection test with a randomly chosen key-exchange and signature algorithm, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`.

It will automatically be detected if it in a standard location, such as `/usr` or `/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1` (for brew on macOS).  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n+Building liboqs requires your system to have OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher already installed. It will automatically be detected if it is under `/usr` or another standard location.  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n \n ### Step 2: Build the fork\n \n-In `<OPENSSH_ROOT>`, first run:\n+Run the following:\n \n ```\n-export OPENSSH_INSTALL=<path-to-install-openssh>\n-autoreconf\n+env OPENSSL_SYS_DIR=<PATH_TO_OPENSSL> ./oqs-scripts/build_openssh.sh\n ```\n \n-Then, run the following:\n-\n-\t./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path-to-openssl>/include \\\n-\t            --with-ldflags=-L<path-to-openssl>/lib   \\\n-\t            --with-libs=-lm                          \\\n-\t            --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL                \\\n-\t            --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL            \\\n-\t            --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs\n-\tmake \n-\tmake install\n+`OPENSSL_SYS_DIR` does not have to be specified if OpenSSL is present under `usr/`.\n \n-Again, the `path-to-openssl` (1.1.1) does not need to be specified if it is in one of the standard locations.\n+As not all tests in the stock regression suite pass, run `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n \n-So, in summary, if OpenSSL is installed in a default location and `oqs-openssh` is to be installed in `/opt/openssh` this command builds and installs `oqs-openssh`: `export OPENSSH_INSTALL=/opt/openssh && autoreconf && ./configure --with-libs=-lm --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs && make && make install`\n-\n-As not all stock `openssh` tests are passing, be sure to execute `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n-\n-To execute a connection test with one of the supported quantum-safe algorithms (chosen at random), run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If all algorithms should be exercized, pass a parameter to this command, e.g., like this: `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n+To execute a connection test with a randomly chosen key-exchange and signature algorithm, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If it is desired that all such combinations should be tested, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n \n ### Running OQS-OpenSSH\n \n The following instructions explain how to establish an SSH connection that uses quantum-safe key exchange and authentication.\n \n #### Generating quantum-safe authentication keys\n \n-To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. In what follows, `<SIG>` is one of the quantum-safe digital signature algorithms listed in [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above.\n-\n-The server generates its key files with the right permissions, and then generates its key pair:\n-\n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_server/\n-\tchmod 700 ~/ssh_server/\n-\ttouch ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\tchmod 600 ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_server/id_<SIG>\n-\n-To enable client-side public-key authentication, the client generates its key pair:\n-\n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_client/\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>\n-\n-The server then adds the client's public key to its authorized keys\n-\n-\tcat ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>.pub >> ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n+To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. To generate keys for all the OQS algorithms supported by fork, simply run `make tests -e LTESTS=\"\"`.\n \n #### Establishing a quantum-safe SSH connection\n \n-In one terminal, run a server:\n+In one

If `<OPENSSH_ROOT>` is the root of the OpenSSH source:\n+The following instructions install liboqs into a subdirectory inside the OpenSSH source.\n \n ```\n-git clone --branch master --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git\n-cd liboqs\n-mkdir build && cd build\n-cmake .. -GNinja -DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_PICNIC=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<OPENSSH_ROOT>/oqs\n-ninja\n-ninja install\n+./oqs-scripts/clone_liboqs.sh\n+./oqs-scripts/build_liboqs.sh\n ```\n \n-Building liboqs requires your system to have OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher already installed. It will automatically be detected if it in a standard location, such as `/usr` or `/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1` (for brew on macOS).  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n+Building liboqs requires your system to have OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher already installed. It will automatically be detected if it is under `/usr` or another standard location.  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n \n ### Step 2: Build the fork\n \n-In `<OPENSSH_ROOT>`, first run:\n+Run the following:\n \n ```\n-export OPENSSH_INSTALL=<path-to-install-openssh>\n-autoreconf\n+env OPENSSL_SYS_DIR=<PATH_TO_OPENSSL> ./oqs-scripts/build_openssh.sh\n ```\n \n-Then, run the following:\n-\n-\t./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path-to-openssl>/include \\\n-\t            --with-ldflags=-L<path-to-openssl>/lib   \\\n-\t            --with-libs=-lm                          \\\n-\t            --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL                \\\n-\t            --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL            \\\n-\t            --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs\n-\tmake \n-\tmake install\n+`OPENSSL_SYS_DIR` does not have to be specified if OpenSSL is present under `usr/`.\n \n-Again, the `path-to-openssl` (1.1.1) does not need to be specified if it is in one of the standard locations.\n+As not all tests in the stock regression suite pass, run `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n \n-So, in summary, if OpenSSL is installed in a default location and `oqs-openssh` is to be installed in `/opt/openssh` this command builds and installs `oqs-openssh`: `export OPENSSH_INSTALL=/opt/openssh && autoreconf && ./configure --with-libs=-lm --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs && make && make install`\n-\n-As not all stock `openssh` tests are passing, be sure to execute `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n-\n-To execute a connection test with one of the supported quantum-safe algorithms (chosen at random), run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If all algorithms should be exercized, pass a parameter to this command, e.g., like this: `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n+To execute a connection test with a randomly chosen key-exchange and signature algorithm, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If it is desired that all such combinations should be tested, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n \n ### Running OQS-OpenSSH\n \n The following instructions explain how to establish an SSH connection that uses quantum-safe key exchange and authentication.\n \n #### Generating quantum-safe authentication keys\n \n-To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. In what follows, `<SIG>` is one of the quantum-safe digital signature algorithms listed in [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above.\n-\n-The server generates its key files with the right permissions, and then generates its key pair:\n-\n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_server/\n-\tchmod 700 ~/ssh_server/\n-\ttouch ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\tchmod 600 ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_server/id_<SIG>\n-\n-To enable client-side public-key authentication, the client generates its key pair:\n-\n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_client/\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>\n-\n-The server then adds the client's public key to its authorized keys\n-\n-\tcat ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>.pub >> ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n+To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. To generate keys for all the OQS algorithms supported by fork, simply run `make tests -e LTESTS=\"\"`.\n \n #### Establishing a quantum-safe SSH connection\n \n-In one terminal, run a server:\n+In one terminal, run the ssh server:\n \n-\t<path-to-openssh>/sbin/sshd -p 2222 -d \\\n+\t<path-to-openssh>/sbin/sshd -D \\\n+\t                            -f <absolute-path-to>/regress/sshd_config \\\n \t                            -o KexAlgorithms=<KEX> \\\n-\t                            -o AuthorizedKeysFile=<absolute-path-to>/ssh_server/authorized_keys \\\n \t                            -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-<SIG> \\\n \t                            -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=ssh-<SIG> \\\n-\t                            -h <absolute-path-to>/ssh_server/id_<SIG>\n+\t                            -h <absolute-path-to>/regress/host.<SIG>\n \n `<KEX>` and `<SIG>` are respectively one of the key exchange and signature (PQ-only or hybrid) algorithms listed in the [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above.\n \n The `-o` options can also be added to the server/client configuration file instead of being specified on the command line.\n \n-The server automatically supports all available hybrid and PQ-only key exchange algorithms.  `sudo` is required on Linux so that sshd can read the shadow password file.\n-\n-In another terminal, run a client:\n+In another terminal, run the ssh client:\n \n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh -p 2222 localhost \\\n+\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh -F <absolute-path-to>/regress/ssh_config \\\n \t                          -o KexAlgorithms=<KEX> \\\n \t                          -o HostKeyAlgorithms=ssh-<SIG>\\\n \t                          -o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=ssh-<SIG> \\\n-\t                          -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \\\n \t                          -o PasswordAuthentication=no \\\n-\t                          -i ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>\n+\t                          -i regress/<SIG>

It will automatically be detected if it in a standard location, such as `/usr` or `/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1` (for brew on macOS).

Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n \n ### Step 2: Build the fork\n \n-In `<OPENSSH_ROOT>`, first run:\n+Run the following:\n \n ```\n-export OPENSSH_INSTALL=<path-to-install-openssh>\n-autoreconf\n+env OPENSSL_SYS_DIR=<PATH_TO_OPENSSL> ./oqs-scripts/build_openssh.sh\n ```\n \n-Then, run the following:\n-\n-\t./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path-to-openssl>/include \\\n-\t            --with-ldflags=-L<path-to-openssl>/lib   \\\n-\t            --with-libs=-lm                          \\\n-\t            --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL                \\\n-\t            --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL            \\\n-\t            --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs\n-\tmake \n-\tmake install\n+`OPENSSL_SYS_DIR` does not have to be specified if OpenSSL is present under `usr/`.\n \n-Again, the `path-to-openssl` (1.1.1) does not need to be specified if it is in one of the standard locations.\n+As not all tests in the stock regression suite pass, run `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n \n-So, in summary, if OpenSSL is installed in a default location and `oqs-openssh` is to be installed in `/opt/openssh` this command builds and installs `oqs-openssh`: `export OPENSSH_INSTALL=/opt/openssh && autoreconf && ./configure --with-libs=-lm --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs && make && make install`\n-\n-As not all stock `openssh` tests are passing, be sure to execute `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n-\n-To execute a connection test with one of the supported quantum-safe algorithms (chosen at random), run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If all algorithms should be exercized, pass a parameter to this command, e.g., like this: `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n+To execute a connection test with a randomly chosen key-exchange and signature algorithm, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`.

In what follows, `<SIG>` is one of the quantum-safe digital signature algorithms listed in [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above.\n-\n-The server generates its key files with the right permissions, and then generates its key pair:\n-\n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_server/\n-\tchmod 700 ~/ssh_server/\n-\ttouch ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\tchmod 600 ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_server/id_<SIG>\n-\n-To enable client-side public-key authentication, the client generates its key pair:\n-\n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_client/\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>\n-\n-The server then adds the client's public key to its authorized keys\n-\n-\tcat ~/ssh_client/id_<SIG>.pub >> ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n+To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. To generate keys for all the OQS algorithms supported by fork, simply run `make tests -e LTESTS=\"\"`.\n \n #### Establishing a quantum-safe SSH connection\n \n-In one terminal, run a server:\n+In one terminal, run the ssh server:\n \n-\t<path-to-openssh>/sbin/sshd -p 2222 -d \\\n+\t<path-to-openssh>/sbin/sshd -D \\\n+\t                            -f <absolute-path-to>/regress/sshd_config \\\n \t

       -h <absolute-path-to>/regress/host.<SIG>\n \n `<KEX>` and `<SIG>` are respectively one of the key exchange and signature (PQ-only or hybrid) algorithms listed in the [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above.\n \n The `-o` options can also be added to the server/client configuration file instead of being specified on the command line.\n \n-The server automatically supports all available hybrid and PQ-only key exchange algorithms.  `sudo` is required on Linux so that sshd can read the shadow password file.\n-\n-In another terminal, run a

If `<OPENSSH_ROOT>` is the root of the OpenSSH source:\n+The following instructions install liboqs into a subdirectory inside the OpenSSH source.\n \n ```\n-git clone --branch master --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git\n-cd liboqs\n-mkdir build && cd build\n-cmake .. -GNinja -DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_PICNIC=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<OPENSSH_ROOT>/oqs\n-ninja\n-ninja install\n+./oqs-scripts/clone_liboqs.sh\n+./oqs-scripts/build_liboqs.sh\n ```\n \n-Building liboqs requires your system to have OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher already installed. It will automatically be detected if it in a standard location, such as `/usr` or `/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1` (for brew on macOS).  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n+Building liboqs requires your system to have OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher already installed. It will automatically be detected if it is under `/usr` or another standard location.  Otherwise, you may need to specify it with `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` added to the `cmake` command.\n \n ### Step 2: Build the fork\n \n-In `<OPENSSH_ROOT>`, first run:\n+Run the following:\n \n ```\n-export OPENSSH_INSTALL=<path-to-install-openssh>\n-autoreconf\n+env OPENSSL_SYS_DIR=<PATH_TO_OPENSSL> ./oqs-scripts/build_openssh.sh\n ```\n \n-Then, run the following:\n-\n-\t./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path-to-openssl>/include \\\n-\t            --with-ldflags=-L<path-to-openssl>/lib   \\\n-\t            --with-libs=-lm                          \\\n-\t            --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL                \\\n-\t            --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL            \\\n-\t            --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs\n-\tmake \n-\tmake install\n-\n-Again, the `path-to-openssl` (1.1.1) does not need to be specified if it is in one of the standard locations.\n-\n-So, in summary, if OpenSSL is installed in a default location and `oqs-openssh` is to be installed in `/opt/openssh` this command builds and installs `oqs-openssh`: `export OPENSSH_INSTALL=/opt/openssh && autoreconf && ./configure --with-libs=-lm --prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL --with-liboqs-dir=`pwd`/oqs && make && make install`\n+`OPENSSL_SYS_DIR` does not have to be specified if OpenSSL is present under `/usr`.\n \n-As not all stock `openssh` tests are passing, be sure to execute `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n+As not all tests in the stock regression suite pass, run `oqs-test/run_tests.sh` instead of simply executing `make tests` to ensure the build was successful.\n \n-To execute a connection test with one of the supported quantum-safe algorithms (chosen at random), run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If all algorithms should be exercized, pass a parameter to this command, e.g., like this: `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that this test can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n+To execute a connection test with a randomly chosen key-exchange and signature algorithm, run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py`. If it is desired that each such combination be tested (exactly once), run `python3 oqs-test/try_connection.py all`. Be aware that the latter can take a long time due to the number of algorithm combinations available.\n \n ### Running OQS-OpenSSH\n \n The following instructions explain how to establish an SSH connection that uses quantum-safe key exchange and authentication.\n \n #### Generating quantum-safe authentication keys\n \n-To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. In what follows, `<SIG>` is one of the quantum-safe digital signature algorithms listed in [Supported Algorithms](#supported-algorithms) section above.\n+To setup quantum-safe authentication, the server (and optionally, the client) need to generate quantum-safe keys. To generate keys for all the OQS algorithms supported by fork, simply run `make tests -e LTESTS=\"\"`.\n \n-The server generates its key files with the right permissions, and then generates its key pair:\n+Keys for a particular `<SIG>` also be generated using the `ssh-keygen` command as follows:\n \n-\tmkdir ~/ssh_server/\n-\tchmod 700 ~/ssh_server/\n-\ttouch ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\tchmod 600 ~/ssh_server/authorized_keys\n-\t<path-to-openssh>/bin/ssh-keygen -t ssh-<SIG> -f ~/ssh_server/id_<SIG>\n-\n-To enable client-side public-key authentication,
