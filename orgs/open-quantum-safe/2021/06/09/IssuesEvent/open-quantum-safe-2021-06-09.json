a discussion from #91 regarding `ssh` and `sshd` command line examples: \r\n\r\n> I'm not sure off the top of my head what's going on here, but it seems like there's a good lead sign_and_send_pubkey to follow up.\r\n\r\n@xvzcf : I traced this down to a routine peeking into the `sshbuf`: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/c600d653b6ce79c81f98d674e99c16d816008301/sshbuf-getput-basic.c#L150 and that routine just delivers \"ssh-\" instead of \"ssh-dilithium3\" as it would be expected. This is on the client side; the server seems to have worked OK: \r\n```\r\ndebug1: /home/mib/ssh_server/authorized_keys:1: key options: agent-forwarding port-forwarding pty user-rc x11-forwarding\r\nAccepted key DILITHIUM3 SHA256:jyUbmvamkb/R663PLoR+bZbv4gK/LsG0M/VYk/tA8jE found at /home/mib/ssh_server/authorized_keys:1\r\n```\r\nSo, Question: Do you recall feeding this buffer correctly with the algorithm name? Where would this be? Possibly at the server? Please let me know if you do not have time for this issue; I'll then keep digging on my own. Simply disabling this bad string check for algorithm name has everything working OK, so it _should_ be a minor issue...
