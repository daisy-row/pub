Are you of @bhess able to look into that?\r\n\r\nYes I can look into that. Did OQS previously already use Travis CI?\r\n\r\n> ps. I'm aware that `secure_cmp32` for BIKE does not handle ppc64le properly, but I did not notice (at the first glance) branching in asm (`objdump -S`) there.\r\n\r\nI think this is something we need to be careful when adding (explicit) support for new platforms. In KEM decapsulation these constant-time comparisons are often critical for CCA security.\r\n\r\n`secure_cmp32` in BIKE contains a warning that the code might be insecure if compiled on platforms other than Intel/ARM64.\r\nSimilarly, the `secure_cmp` function in BIKE seems to also depend on the platform and compiler used:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/d9fb4e0e81ccd0a0972b38743404d982fe0a90c1/src/kem/bike/additional_r3/utilities.h#L62-L73\r\n\r\nMost often this should work ok. But trying with a few compilers, at least gcc on AVR compiles the `return (0 == res);` to a conditional branch. In this case the implementation in `OQS_MEM_secure_bcmp` would be more portable.\r\n\r\nEspecially on older platforms there are examples of instructions and code that are not constant-time as one would expect. Some are summarized in https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/893:\r\n\r\n- x86: bit-shifting on NetBurst (Pentium 4) CPUs is not constant-time. Timing depends on the shift count.\r\n- PowerPC 32bit, with gcc: 32 x 32 -> 64 bit multiplication compiles to conditional code.\r\n- ARM Cortex M3 doesn't offer constant-time 32 x 32 -> 64 bit multiplications\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if TIMECOP used in our tests would detect such non constant-time behavior.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-06-25T13:32:57Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

I'm aware that secure_cmp32 for BIKE does not handle ppc64le properly, but I did not notice (at the first glance) branching in asm (objdump -S) there.\r\n>\r\n> I think this is something we need to be careful when adding (explicit) support for new platforms. In KEM decapsulation these constant-time comparisons are often critical for CCA security.\r\n\r\nI agree, but in this case it's clear that the C code is deficient. Both secure_cmp32 and secure_cmp could be rewritten in a way that makes it *more likely* that a compiler will output constant time code.\r\n\r\nOf course we can't provide a \"guarantee\" of constant time behaviour for any C code on any architecture. The best we can do is say that we've audited implementation W on architecture X when compiled with version Y of compiler Z.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure if TIMECOP used in our tests would detect such non constant-time behavior.\r\n\r\nIt would not detect most of these. Maybe the PowerPC multiplication, but I'd have to look at the actual instructions that the compiler outputs.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-06-25T15:01:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
