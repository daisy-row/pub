So, problem only if OQS algorithms are enabled on the server side.\r\n\r\nThanks for that confirmation -- that then might explain things: As soon as one of the \"crazy big\" algorithms is enabled, the larger --and incompatible-- buffer size might be triggered. I need to read up on the SSH protocol to understand if/when this occurs (maybe the server proposes them all to the client and in so doing the problem hits? Maybe @dstebila or @xvzcf you already know?). Might disabling/removing Sphincs and Rainbow host keys already suffice (?) to achieve your stated goal:\r\n\r\n> client users should be able to choose to connect with OQS (if they enable it) or using generic algorithms and generic OpenSSH clients\r\n\r\nto which I fully agree.\r\n\r\nNow, after having built also the old (7.9) `OQS-openssh` locally I still fail to reproduce the error you are reporting, though: I still can connect OK (albeit very slowly) with a stock ssh to an OQS-sshd... So, could I ask you which exact platform you are using? Do you possibly have a docker image with which to reproduce things _exactly_? Or could you share all steps/the script that led to the behaviour reported?
