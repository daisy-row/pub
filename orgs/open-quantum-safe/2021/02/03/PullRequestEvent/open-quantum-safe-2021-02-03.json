An alternative is to wait for #883 to land and copy Dilithium directly from upstream. It's not clear to me how close #883 is to completion, hence this PR.\r\n\r\n> Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n\r\nYes, there are significant changes between round 2 and round 3 Dilithium.\r\n\r\n> Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding or removing?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\nYes, it removes dilithium4, adds dilithium5, and adds the \"_aes\" variants of dilithium2, dilithium3, and
