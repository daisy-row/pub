(so we'll catch broken core components after 1 minute instead of 10.)\r\n* Add a \"request-approval\" job (https://circleci.com/blog/adding-approval-jobs-to-your-ci-pipeline/) after the linux_x64 jobs but before the arm_emulated jobs.\r\n* Make the arm_emulated jobs depend on request-approval.\r\n* Make address-sanitizer run only on audit branches.\r\n\r\nWhoever reviews a PR can approve the arm builds once everything else is passing.

Then I proceeded to https://github.com/engine-corner/Lesson-2-A-digest, which used to work wonderfully, but does not work since OpenSSL_1.1.1 (incompatible, requires old API). It used to have an RSA engine example too, but it's disappeared now (even less compatible with 1.1.1 than the Digest example, and completely out of sync with 3.0).\r\n\r\n> The README gives you examples.
