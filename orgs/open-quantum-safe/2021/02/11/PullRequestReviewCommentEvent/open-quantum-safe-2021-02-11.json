It's harmless to retry, since CircleCI will kill our python process if it really wants us to shut down.\r\n\r\nThis PR also disambiguates the above possibilities by raising a more informative assertion error in the timeout case. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    try:\r\n        out, _ = proc.communicate(input=input, timeout=480)\r\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as T:\r\n        proc.kill()\r\n        assert False, str(T)\r\n```\r\nNote: The python documentation suggests that the proc.kill() is unnecessary. I've left it in case it's there from experience with a race condition or something.","created_at":"2021-02-10T22:02:22Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T06:23:57Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b8b55292f599264e49095149421c7ece0465f9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/b1fe356a118fbca50842ee0b37eb0fd4b7a652b1","head":{"label":"jschanck:ci.sigkill","ref":"ci.sigkill","sha":"b1fe356a118fbca50842ee0b37eb0fd4b7a652b1","user":{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":332056305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzIwNTYzMDU=","name":"liboqs","full_name":"jschanck/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck/liboqs","description":"C

The -9 return code came from our own call to proc.kill().\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to retry a subprocess if we're running in CircleCI and our subprocess receives a SIGKILL. It's harmless to retry, since CircleCI will kill our python process if it really wants us to shut down.\r\n\r\nThis PR also disambiguates the above possibilities by raising a more informative assertion error in the timeout case. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    try:\r\n        out, _ = proc.communicate(input=input, timeout=480)\r\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as T:\r\n        proc.kill()\r\n        assert False, str(T)\r\n```\r\nNote: The python documentation suggests that the proc.kill() is unnecessary. I've left it in case it's there from experience with a race condition or something.","created_at":"2021-02-10T22:02:22Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T06:27:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b8b55292f599264e49095149421c7ece0465f9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/b1fe356a118fbca50842ee0b37eb0fd4b7a652b1","head":{"label":"jschanck:ci.sigkill","ref":"ci.sigkill","sha":"b1fe356a118fbca50842ee0b37eb0fd4b7a652b1","user":{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":332056305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzIwNTYzMDU=","name":"liboqs","full_name":"jschanck/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck/liboqs","description":"C

It's harmless to retry, since CircleCI will kill our python process if it really wants us to shut down.\r\n\r\nThis PR also disambiguates the above possibilities by raising a more informative assertion error in the timeout case. \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    try:\r\n        out, _ = proc.communicate(input=input, timeout=480)\r\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as T:\r\n        proc.kill()\r\n        assert False, str(T)\r\n```\r\nNote: The python documentation suggests that the proc.kill() is unnecessary.

CircleCI actually sent SIGKILL to our subprocess.\r\n2. We hit our self-imposed timeout. The -9 return code came from our own call to proc.kill().\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to retry a subprocess if we're running in CircleCI and our subprocess receives a SIGKILL.

something.","created_at":"2021-02-10T22:02:22Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T14:48:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b8b55292f599264e49095149421c7ece0465f9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/b1fe356a118fbca50842ee0b37eb0fd4b7a652b1","head":{"label":"jschanck:ci.sigkill","ref":"ci.sigkill","sha":"b1fe356a118fbca50842ee0b37eb0fd4b7a652b1","user":{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":332056305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzIwNTYzMDU=","name":"liboqs","full_name":"jschanck/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jschanck","id":25615540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE1NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25615540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck","html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jschanck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jschanck/liboqs","description":"C
