[ssl/ssl_local.h](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/ssl_local.h#L207), there are `#define`s that assign one-hot encodings to each signature algorithm. These encodings are used in [ssl/ssl_cert_table.h](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/ssl_cert_table.h#L26), and are assigned to a uint32_t variable called `amask` [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/ssl_local.h#L1924).\r\n\r\nSince the encodings are one-hot, at most 32 different signature algorithms can be encoded, and since 8 bits are already used up by OpenSSL by default, at most 24 different OQS signature algorithms can be encoded and assigned to `amask` at any given instant. \r\n\r\nThis (possibly?) prevents us from enabling all signature algorithms by default, and the question is how we should deal with this.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/785233513","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/282#issuecomment-785233513","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/282","id":785233513,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4NTIzMzUxMw==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-24T17:15:22Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T17:15:22Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Not that I'm aware of, I just see this as a secondary nice-to-have.\r\n\r\nThen I'd say we take our responsibility for the environment more serious and run _all_ algs as rarely as reasonable.\r\n\r\n> When I took a shot at something like this last year, it was not well received, but we can revisit this.\r\n\r\nSo maybe a topic for our call (@dstebila ?)","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-02-24T17:15:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
