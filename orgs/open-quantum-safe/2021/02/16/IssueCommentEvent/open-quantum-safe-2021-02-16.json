As we did not see the need for running `make test` cross platform until now -- could you let us know whether you found new issues adding those tests (probably applying the workaround) that would make it prudent for us to add this to our CI matrix?\r\n\r\nBTW, while writing this, the following sequence allowed me just now to \"manually\" pass `make test` in OQS-OpenSSL1_1_1 on Linux:\r\n```\r\n# in src/liboqs:\r\ncmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/src/oqs-openssl/oqs -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .. && ninja && ninja install\r\n# in src/oqs-openssl:\r\nexport INSTALLDIR=/opt/oqssa\r\nLDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-rpath -Wl,${INSTALLDIR}/lib\" ./config shared --prefix=${INSTALLDIR}\r\nmake -j 4 && make install && make test\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this fail on OSX?

I now wonder why this doesn't happen on OSX...\r\n\r\nI think it does *not* happen on OSX because `liboqs.dylib` is **not** a part of the generated OpenSSL (nor `oqs-openssl`) binaries, therefore it is not copied.\r\n\r\nA \"dumb\" approach for the install script would be to just \"`sudo cp *.dylib $INSTALLDIR/lib/`\", in which case `liboqs.dylib` would \"magically\" appear at the destination. But I'm pretty certain OpenSSL (and, therefore, oqs-openssl) does **not** use such approach.\r\n\r\nAn expected way would be something like \"`sudo cp libssl.1.1.1.dylib $INSTALLDIR/lib/ && sudo cp libcrypto.1.1.1.dylib $INSTALLDIR/lib/`\", in which case any *extraneous* library that happens to be in the source dir, does *not* get copied. I'm pretty sure that's what's happening on MacOSX.\r\n\r\n> In general, I'd suggest installing `liboqs.dylib` into the same dir where the openssl+crypto.dylibs wind up after install\r\n\r\nOh, but I do! In my case, `liboqs` is built *first*, and installed into `$INSRALLDIR/lib` (aka `/opt/local/lib`). Then `oqs-openssl` is configured and built. And once installed, it works just fine. **But** tests fail to load `liboqs.dylib` thanks to the convoluted `make test` sequence of scripts.\r\n\r\nI will need to test your workaround with passing `LDFLAGS=\"-Wl,-rpath -Wl,${INSTALLDIR}/lib\"` to the oqs-openssl `./Configure` command. It seems promising.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-02-16T16:04:26Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
