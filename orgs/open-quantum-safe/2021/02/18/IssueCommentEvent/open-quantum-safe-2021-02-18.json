They do run in parallel in 13 mins: \r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57787676/108313509-bc2e3c80-71b8-11eb-8cdb-ad3fddabc5ac.png)\r\n\r\nTo prove jobs in our CCI workflow setup already do run in parallel, here's how the ARM jobs are presently executing:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57787676/108313840-3bbc0b80-71b9-11eb-800b-80c62f21e3cf.png)\r\n\r\nOn this basis, what if we move this all into one job? Isn't it so that this job will run (nearly - we save docker setup and clone) 3 times longer if it's just doing the same combinations (and considerably longer if we'd test the full matrix)? It needs to build all the same objects from source with the same fixed set of CPUs (within one CCI job) that we already use at maximum availability building with `ninja`.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at [using CCI job parallelism](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/parallelism-faster-jobs/) (instead of that delivered by [workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#fan-outfan-in-workflow-example) as already used in our CCI config) and the option to at least run the tests of the different builds in parallel (after having built all objects in different `build` directories of _one_ job), another problem appears: Our `pytest` harness only permits testing a single `build` folder; one presently cannot specify running tests on executables in different folders, say `build_clang_noopenssl` and `build_gcc_openssl`) as per (for example) https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/952c628051f2b88aee02952abc46be0ac8f09ab7/tests/helpers.py#L68 . But even if we fix that, would we speed up stuff considerably given `pytest` already uses all core available to a single job's executor?\r\n\r\nAsking for feedback especially from @xvzcf and @jschanck : Am I completely misunderstanding the proposal here? Or misunderstanding what CCI offers?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2021-02-18T07:06:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
