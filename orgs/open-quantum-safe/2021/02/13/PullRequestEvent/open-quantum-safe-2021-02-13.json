For example, with this patch, if you want to build liboqs with only the Kyber512 and Dilithium2 algorithms you can use:\r\n```\r\ncmake -GNinja -DOQS_MINIMAL_BUILD=ON -DOQS_KEM_DEFAULT=OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_512 -DOQS_SIG_DEFAULT=OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_2 ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will build the exact match for the default kem and sig and also any \"_aesni\" or \"_avx2\" implementations that are supported by the platform.\r\n\r\nOpening this PR, at @baentsch's recommendation, for discussion about whether this is a useful feature / what else we would like it to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Tacking on proposed CI workflow from
