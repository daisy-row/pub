Build and install LIBOQS_SHARED\r\n2. Symlink the slared library `liboqs.0.dylib` to where OQS-OPENSSL will be installed\r\n3. When configuring OQS-OPENSSL (shared), make sure the appropriate LDFLAGS are provided\r\n     - that includes the correct RPATH settings\r\n\r\nThis allows \"smooth\" `make all` *and* `make test`. \r\n\r\nCan I also suggest that you change Xcode-11.9 to Xcode-12.4 or whatever's the closest to 12.4?\r\n\r\nIn the `config.yml` I did not see where the arguments to `./config` or `./Configure` are provided. `LDFLAGS` should become a part of those, IMHO.
