We built everything using nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress github repository. Specifically, we replaced the base image in DockerfileForAlpine with your nginx(oqs-demos) image, and changed the path of the Dockerfile in the makefile to match - no nginx-plus needed. We have been attempting to deploy this on google kubernetes engine(manifest deployment) using deployment nginx-ingress.yaml.\r\nWe have rebuilt your proxy image with a newer nginx version, but that did not affect the error. We think the source of the error may be the USER in DockerfileForAlpine or the paths chosen in the ./configure command in your proxy image.\r\n\r\nplease help , thanks for your efforts!\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-09-27T18:15:34Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
