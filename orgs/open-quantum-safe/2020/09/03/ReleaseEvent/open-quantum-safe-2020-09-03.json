More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.\r\n\r\n**OQS-OpenSSH** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) OpenSSH.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is the 2020-08 snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSH, released on August 11, 2020. Its release page on GitHub is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/releases/tag/OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2020-08. This release is intended to be used with liboqs version 0.4.0.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth snapshot release of the OQS fork of OpenSSH.  It is based on OpenSSH 7.9 portable 1.\r\n\r\n- Uses the updated NIST Round 2 submissions added to liboqs 0.4.0, as described in the [liboqs release notes](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/RELEASE.md).\r\n\r\nDeprecations\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAs a result of NIST's announcement of Round 3 of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, this is the last release of OQS-OpenSSH that contain algorithms from Round 2 that are not Round 3 finalists or alternate candidates. Those algorithms will be removed in the next release. The algorithms in question are: NewHope, ThreeBears, MQDSS, and qTesla. These algorithms are considered deprecated within OQS-OpenSSH will receive no updates after this release."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-09-03T15:02:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
