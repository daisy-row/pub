While building up a freeradiusd with the 1.1.1 branch of this fork, i encountered a problem when using rather long curves_list. It turns out the maximum amount of curves in a list is defined in ssl/t1_lib.c as:\r\n\r\n`# define MAX_CURVELIST   OSSL_NELEM(nid_list)`\r\n\r\n`nid_list` only includes ecdc curves, while the pq algos and hybrid implementations are defined in `oqs_nid_list` and `oqs_hybrid_nid_list`. When using more curves than member in `nid_list`, the curve list evaluation function fails silently.\r\n\r\nThis small fix works for me:\r\n\r\n`# define MAX_CURVELIST   (OSSL_NELEM(nid_list)+OSSL_NELEM(oqs_nid_list)+OSSL_NELEM(oqs_hybrid_nid_list))`\r\n\r\nIf you have no objections against this change, i can send a PR.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRobin ","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-09-22T14:56:10Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
