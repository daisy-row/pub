Navie random selection algorithm has a best-case time complexity of &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>) whereas the Fisher–Yates shuffle has the worst-case complexity of O(n)(since random element is selected in O(1)). The downside is that while naive random selection uses  O(&omega;<sub>r</sub>) &thickapprox; O(&Sqrt;n) memory, Fisher-Yates shuffle uses O(n) memory. \r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Navie random selection algorithm has a best-case time complexity of &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>) whereas the Fisher–Yates shuffle has the worst-case complexity of O(n)(since random element is selected in O(1)). The downside is that while naive random selection uses  O(&omega;<sub>r</sub>) &thickapprox; O(&Sqrt;n) memory, Fisher-Yates shuffle uses O(n) memory. \r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Navie random selection algorithm has a best-case time complexity of &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>) whereas the Fisher–Yates shuffle has the worst-case complexity of O(n)(since random element is selected in O(1)). The downside is that while naive random selection uses O(&omega;<sub>r</sub>) &thickapprox; O(&Sqrt;n) memory, Fisher-Yates shuffle uses O(n) memory.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Navie random selection algorithm has a best-case time complexity of &Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>) whereas the Fisher–Yates shuffle has the worst-case complexity of O(n)(since random element is selected in O(1)). The downside is that while naive random selection uses O(&omega;<sub>r</sub>) &thickapprox; O(&Sqrt;n) memory, Fisher-Yates shuffle uses O(n) memory.\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
