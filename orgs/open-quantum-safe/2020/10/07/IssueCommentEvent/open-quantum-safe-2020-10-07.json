I did some experiments, and I now do have a [certified Kyber 512 public key](https://gist.github.com/thomwiggers/403a42d32ca5f1d90e2a7c506f54ac09). \r\n\r\nThis should then be useful to consider OPTLS-like setups.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of course is `EVP_PKEY_derive` being almost but not quite suitable for this task. I have not tackled this problem yet, but it may be possible to slightly extend the API to obtain a ciphertext instead of the public key. That seems the main challenge, I think it should be possible to override the `derive` function such that it conditionally encapsulates or decapsulates:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nstatic int pkey_oqs_derive(EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *key, size_t *keylen) {\r\n    OQS_KEY *oqs_key = (OQS_KEY*) ctx->pkey->pkey.ptr;\r\n    OQS_KEY *oqs_peer = (OQS_KEY*) ctx->peerkey->pkey.ptr;\r\n\r\n    *keylen = oqs_size(ctx->pkey);\r\n    if (key == NULL) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    if (oqs_peer->ciphertext) {\r\n        if (OQS_KEM_decaps(oqs_key->k, key, oqs_peer->ciphertext, oqs_key->privkey) == OQS_SUCCESS) {\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        oqs_peer->ciphertext = OPENSSL_malloc(*keylen);\r\n        if (OQS_KEM_encaps(oqs_key->k, key, oqs_peer->ciphertext, oqs_peer->pubkey) == OQS_SUCCESS) {\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, that does mean that the users of the EVP API need to do some detection \"is this method a KEM\" and obtain and/or set the ciphertext if needed.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/705020109","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/59#issuecomment-705020109","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/59","id":705020109,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNTAyMDEwOQ==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-07T15:37:52Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T15:37:52Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing this in OQS-OpenSSL since it looks like this will be available to us once we move to OpenSSL 3.0.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-10-07T15:37:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
