yesterday's discussion on checking all algorithms to use common code, and evaluating the (runtime) cost to suitably \"XKCP-guard\" all common code entry points, I'd need to ask (surely @xvzcf , everyone else invited to chime in, too) for revisiting the suggested use of XKCP for selecting the properly optimized common code: The runtime feature-availability check for each \"common code\" invocation, e.g. of SHA3, would add a noticeable, quite probably prohibitive, performance penalty to each algorithm using such shared code as typically, such invocations occur very often during each algorithm execution. This check also is not necessary as such algorithms already did the runtime feature check at invocation: Wouldn't it be a correct assessment that those algorithms need common code (symbols) that are (compiled) as optimized as the baseline algorithms _as well as_ common code (symbols) that are/have been compiled not using specific CPU features and call/link to either variant based on the actual CPU features encountered when executing? In essence, #724 looks like a better solution for the problem from a performance perspective than XKCP, even though it requires introducing additional symbols and code (say, \"_avx2\") for the same functionality (but different compile-time options).","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-10-29T08:41:33Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

all code is designed such that it can not only be configured at compile time to deal with different CPU feature sets (e.g., presence/absence of AVX2) but also handle those gracefully at runtime, e.g, by automatically falling back to a non-optimised version of the same functionality.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all code compiled with, e.g., `-mavx2` should also run without error on CPUs that do *not* have support for all features (AVX2 in this example).\r\n\r\nTo help with this, we will integrate the [CPU features](https://github.com/google/cpu_features) library and for starters will add warnings if the library is running on a CPU with a feature set different from the one encountered during build (reducing the surprise when one encounters an `illegal instruction exception` during execution until this issue is fully addressed :-)\r\n\r\nEdited by @dstebila to add:\r\n\r\n- [X] Use cpu\\_features instead of \\_\\_builtin\\_cpu\r\n- [X] Update copy-from-pqclean schemes to do runtime

all code is designed such that it can not only be configured at compile time to deal with different CPU feature sets (e.g., presence/absence of AVX2) but also handle those gracefully at runtime, e.g, by automatically falling back to a non-optimised version of the same functionality.\r\n\r\nIn other words, all code compiled with, e.g., `-mavx2` should also run without error on CPUs that do *not* have support for all features (AVX2 in this example).\r\n\r\nTo help with this, we will integrate the [CPU features](https://github.com/google/cpu_features) library and for starters will add warnings if the library is running on a CPU with a feature set different from the one encountered during build (reducing the surprise when one encounters an `illegal instruction exception` during execution until this issue is fully addressed :-)\r\n\r\nEdited by @dstebila to add:\r\n\r\n- [X] Use cpu\\_features instead of \\_\\_builtin\\_cpu\r\n- [X] Update copy-from-pqclean schemes to do runtime
