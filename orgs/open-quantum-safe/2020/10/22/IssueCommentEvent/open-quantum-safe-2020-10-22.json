In particular, the -curves parameter is an OQS-OpenSSL (only) extension (i.e., not in upstream openssl) that enforces use of a specific KEM algorithm. Maybe something with the path isn't quite right in your docker image such that plain-vanilla openssl is triggered (that --again-- does not know \"-curves\")?
