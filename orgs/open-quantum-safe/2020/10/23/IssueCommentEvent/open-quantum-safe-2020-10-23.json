This simple fix allows something like this to happen in a custom project:\r\n```cmake\r\nFetchContent_Declare(liboqs\r\n    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/onavratil-monetplus/liboqs\r\n)\r\nmessage(STATUS  \"Fetching liboqs...this may take a while\")\r\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(liboqs)\r\n# ....\r\n\r\ntarget_link_libraries(myCustomTarget PUBLIC OQS::oqs)\r\n```\r\nAnd boom! There we go, no need to install the lib system-wide prior to project build, allows to use static version of the lib etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nNow I am nothing for a cmake professional, but this solution works nicely for me, and hopefully can help someone else as well.\r\n\r\nOn a footnote, the fix is based on a discussion regarding my desparate attempts to use cmake.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61504626/the-cmake-quandary","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/714828614","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/762#issuecomment-714828614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/762","id":714828614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDgyODYxNA==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-23T00:07:27Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T00:07:27Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xvzcf Can this be merged?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-10-23T00:07:27Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

This simple fix allows something like this to happen in a custom project:\r\n```cmake\r\nFetchContent_Declare(liboqs\r\n    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/onavratil-monetplus/liboqs\r\n)\r\nmessage(STATUS  \"Fetching liboqs...this may take a while\")\r\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(liboqs)\r\n# ....\r\n\r\ntarget_link_libraries(myCustomTarget PUBLIC OQS::oqs)\r\n```\r\nAnd boom! There we go, no need to install the lib system-wide prior to project build, allows to use static version of the lib etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nNow I am nothing for a cmake professional, but this solution works nicely for me, and hopefully can help someone else as well.\r\n\r\nOn a footnote, the fix is based on a discussion regarding my desparate attempts to use cmake.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61504626/the-cmake-quandary","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/715332683","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/762#issuecomment-715332683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/762","id":715332683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTMzMjY4Mw==","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-23T13:13:39Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T13:13:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favour of https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/840","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-10-23T13:13:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
