Quick understanding question: (Why) Do we truly still (need to?) maintain the 'curve ID' in the `oqs-template/generate.yml` file? If I understand it right, those 'nids' have no relationship whatsoever with the true NIDs (which are generated by the `crypto/objects/obj_mac.num` generator in combination with the openssl `make generate_crypto_objects` script) and which in all other places are referenced by #defines, right?\r\n> \r\n> --> Anything speaking against dropping them (in favour of using the true NIDs)? As the structure of openssl has changed (evp_int.h, asn1_int.h gone, ssl_locl.h renamed) since the last time the tool was run, we anyway have to touch more things than just `generate.yml`....\r\n\r\nThe NIDs in `obj_mac.num` are OpenSSL-internal identifiers. The curve IDs in the `generate.yml` file are TLS 1.3 (private-use) identifiers, and are referenced [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/ssl_local.h#L480) and [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/t1_trce.c#L536) for example."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-04-30T18:04:47Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
