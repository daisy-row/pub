Example: Disabling Frodo in liboqs has it still report Frodo (as active) in`OQS_KEM_alg_identifier` (also btw causing a CI failure in `tests/example_kem.c`) and in consequence cause an error when running `openssl speed` (which uses this list to determine which algorithms are actually supported by a specific `liboqs` library build).\r\n\r\n--> Would it be sensible to also create a liboqs issue for this?
