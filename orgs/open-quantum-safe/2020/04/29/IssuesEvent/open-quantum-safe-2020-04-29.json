The only thing that came to mind is that there was a recent (March 24, 2020) release of Xcode (version 11.4), that upgraded clang to version 11.0.3 and llvm to version 9, compared to previously using clang version 11.0.0 and llvm version 8.  \r\n\r\nI tried building liboqs with gcc-9, and the errors went away.
