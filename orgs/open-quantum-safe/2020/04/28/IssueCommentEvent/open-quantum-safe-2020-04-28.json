\r\n\r\nI'm fully aware of the desire of the OQS team to have control over available KEMs and that long default lists can lead to ussues. \r\nOn the other hand, OpenSSL also allows enabling/disabling algos during build time - and I do have an issue now being unable to use kyber1024 in my test environment. \r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/620432430","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/172#issuecomment-620432430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/172","id":620432430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDQzMjQzMA==","user":{"login":"martinschmatz","id":35571346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTcxMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/35571346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz","html_url":"https://github.com/martinschmatz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martinschmatz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-28T07:29:31Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T07:29:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Adding...\r\n`-DOQS_DEFAULT_GROUPS=\"prime256v1:secp384r1:secp521r1:X25519:X448:kyber512:kyber768:kyber1024:p256_kyber512:p256_kyber768:p256_kyber1024\"`\r\n...when `./Configure`-ing OQS Openssl worked for me.\r\nMany thanks!"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-04-28T07:29:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
