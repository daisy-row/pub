Also, one question: How can it be that build+test on Linux takes 1.5 minutes while testing on Windows takes more than 15 minutes alone? Observing the test run, it's mostly the \"SPHINCS\" family running ultra-slow on Win. Side note: Win-build is a few seconds slower than Linux, but not much, so the CircleCI VMs for Windows are not _that_ much worse than the Linux VMs; in other words, there's something weird in the Windows test run that I don't understand."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/607905119","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/690#issuecomment-607905119","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/690","id":607905119,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzkwNTExOQ==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-02T15:10:04Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T15:10:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Alternatively/in addition: Is there anything speaking against merging this PR as it won't change anything in the OQS account (it simply won't run if I'm not mistaken) -- but would ensure I get a minimum of quick sanity checking regarding Windows when my trial AppVeyor account terminates (by April 9).\r\n\r\nI suppose that's fine."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-04-02T15:10:04Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
