RC2 flipped the order of sigs and KEXs in the NID list (vs. RC1) therefore breaking one of our checks. Since these values are internal to OpenSSL and 3rd party apps should rely on their exact values, it would be useful to provide IS_OQS_KEM and IS_OQS_SIG macros to check if a particular NID is ours.\r\n\r\n(This would be an enhancement after the June release)"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-06-30T18:35:20Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
