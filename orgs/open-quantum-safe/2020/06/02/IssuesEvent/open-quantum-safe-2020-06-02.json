Before doing that, we should identify which things merit manual checking.  We don't have a specification of what things should be present in the file.  So I'm looking for some discussion in this issue about what to include.\r\n\r\n- What is the difference between 'source of implementation' and 'implementation version' -- do we need both or is one sufficient?\r\n- Check that the license is indeed correct.\r\n- Probably don't need a language field, everything is C or C + assembly.\r\n- 'Architectures supported in liboqs master branch' should be updated:\r\n  - The language 'liboqs master branch' is old (to back when we also had nist-branch) and should be removed\r\n  - This should be where we report what types of optimizations etc can be built (avx2, bmi, etc.).  What is the best way to word and structure that?\r\n\r\nSeeking feedback from @baentsch @christianpaquin @xvzcf @vsoftco "}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-06-02T17:18:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
