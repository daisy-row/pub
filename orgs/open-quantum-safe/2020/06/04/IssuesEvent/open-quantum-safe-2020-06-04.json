I build OpenSSL 1.1 manually from source on the problematic machine. I have checked liboqs.a by `nm` on both the machines and they seem to contain identical symbols.\r\n\r\nSince LibOQS switched to OpenSSL 1.1+, there is no FIPS module available (afaik is expected in OpenSSL 3.0). If my assumptions are correct, then OQS will not be runable on distros without packaged OpenSSL with vendor-provided FIPS module.\r\n\r\nI have tried numerous workarounds yet the error is always the same (and always on the far far side of linking phase).\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-06-04T09:24:05Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
