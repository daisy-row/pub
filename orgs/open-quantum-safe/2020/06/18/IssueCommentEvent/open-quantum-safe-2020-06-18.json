OK, that certainly works -- but I see two disadvantages:\r\na) Inefficiency: All liboqs dependencies need to be installed at each CI run. And there can be _many_ such runs over time: CI should run nightly (possibly very briefly to see nothing has changed in both `liboqs-java` _and_ `liboqs` itself; but also possibly re-building/testing everything in `liboqs-java` also if \"only\" `liboqs` got changed that day).\r\nb) We don't get CI tests across different platforms this way. But I'm not enough of a Java expert to judge this: Can we be sure that this `liboqs-java` will work OK on Ubuntu, Debian, Centos, Alpine and OSX if it passes the test using only the CircleCI-JDK image?\r\n\r\nTo address a) I could offer to put out to the DockerHub `openquantumsafe` space a new (circleCI-JDK-based) ci-test image already incorporating the liboqs prerequisites. But I'd rather do that only if you could confirm b) is no issue.

Theoretically, it should be able to run on any system that supports a JRE (and a JDK in our case for JNI) without any problems. However, to be honest I do not have much experience with Centos and Alpine, so I cannot guarantee that. I'm fine switching to the ci-containers from OQS if you think that's the way to go.\r\n\r\nIf we use the OQS ci containers, before you push the images to DockerHub could you verify that there is a `jni.h` header inside the `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/include/` directory? Also, it would be convenient setting the JAVA_HOME environmental variable in the containers since the path is different in every OS.
