These encodings are used in [ssl/ssl_cert_table.h](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/ssl_cert_table.h#L26), and are assigned to a uint32_t variable called \"amask\" (declared [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/ssl/ssl_local.h#L1924)).\r\n\r\nSince the encodings are one-hot, at most 32 different signature algorithms can be encoded, and since 8 bits are already used up by OpenSSL by default, at most 24 different OQS signature algorithms can be encoded and assigned to \"amask\" at any given instant.\r\n\r\nWe should look into overcoming this limitation."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-06-18T20:11:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
