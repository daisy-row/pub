Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nAdds HQC from PQClean.  HQC makes use of nistseedexpander so this adds that as well.\r\n\r\nDepends on #803 \r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #709.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [No] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [Yes] Does this PR change the the list of algorithms available -- either adding or removing?  (If so, PRs in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH will also be required by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\nNote that HQC-256 variants use lots of stack space (similar to Classic McEliece).  Downstream consumers will have to be updated to take this into account.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/668682951","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/804#issuecomment-668682951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/804","id":668682951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODY4Mjk1MQ==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-04T16:01:35Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T16:01:35Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Replaced by #804","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-08-04T16:01:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
