More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH 7.9 portable 1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into SSH in our fork of OpenSSH 7.9; see the [OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master) branch of our OpenSSH fork's repository.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/thales-e-security/goliboqs\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is the first release candidate of version 0.4.0 of liboqs.  It was released on August 4, 2020.  Its project page on GitHub is at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/milestone/9.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.3.0 release of liboqs.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- HQC: Added version 2019/08/24\r\n- NewHope: Update to version 1.1\r\n- SIKE: Update to version 3.3\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Dilithium: Use version directly from PQCrystals GitHub\r\n- Picnic: Update to v3.0\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- AES-NI support when liboqs does not use OpenSSL for AES\r\n\r\nDeprecations\r\n------------\r\n\r\nAs a result of NIST's announcement of Round 3 of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, the 0.4.x series will be the last release(s) of liboqs that contain algorithms from Round 2 that are not Round 3 finalists or alternate candidates.  Those algorithms will be removed in the 0.5.0 release.  The algorithms in question are: NewHope, ThreeBears, MQDSS, and qTesla.  These algorithms are considered deprecated within liboqs and will receive no updates after this release.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-08-05T00:26:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
