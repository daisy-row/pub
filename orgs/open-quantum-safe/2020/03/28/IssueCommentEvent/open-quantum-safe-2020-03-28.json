I get the same error when I run the exchange with classical KEX and auth algs: killing the server process seems to trigger the new 111e error (\"unexpected eof while reading\" I mentioned above). I tried to terminate the connection correctly by passing `Q` to the client (after `GET /`), but that doesn't seem to work. Anyone with better scripting jediness knows how to do that?
