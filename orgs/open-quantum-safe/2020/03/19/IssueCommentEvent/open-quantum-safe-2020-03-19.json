respect to `test_style` failing, what does the output say? Do you have `astyle` installed? \r\n\r\nWith respect to the rest, if an installation prefix is not specified, it defaults to `/usr/local` on UNIX-like systems. That's why when you run `ninja install` it attempts to copy `liboqs.a` to `/usr/local/lib`. It probably fails without root because you lack the permissions to copy files there.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to install the headers and libraries to a directory of your choosing, which, say, is `<DIR>`, you have to pass the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>` option. For more information, see the [CMake documentation for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html). \r\n\r\nTo use liboqs-python, you have to build liboqs as a shared library. This is controlled by the `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[ON|OFF]` option. The build steps would therefore be: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmake .. -G\"Ninja\" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR> -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`\r\nninja\r\nninja install\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce `liboqs` is installed in `<DIR>`, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python), and make sure to correctly specify the `LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables.\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-03-19T15:19:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
