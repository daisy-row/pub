with @christianpaquin: 1 _conceptually_ different algorithm per family also was my thinking. So maybe keep (frodo)_shake and _aes variants, but certainly not more than 1 from `sidhp...` and `sikep...`. \r\n\r\nBut I see a bigger issue now when looking at this code: With this, we really completely remove algorithms from `openssl` usage -- which isn't so great given what we currently have (the ability to run all candidates side by side, e.g., in performance as well as further downstream app tests, also against classic crypto of the same level). \r\n\r\nSo what about this proposal (maybe now, maybe later): Create 3 different lists instead of only 1 (`eccurves_default`), say `ecccurves_level1` (& _2,_3) and make them \"run-time activatable\", e.g. by switching this OpenSSL code\r\n```\r\n        if (s->ext.supportedgroups == NULL) {\r\n            *pgroups = eccurves_default;\r\n            *pgroupslen = OSSL_NELEM(eccurves_default);\r\n        } else {\r\n```\r\nsuitably, e.g., to something like this\r\n```\r\n        if (s->ext.supportedgroups == NULL) {\r\n            switch (atoi(getenv(\"NIST_STRENGTH_LEVEL\"))) { // or some command line option?\r\n            2: \r\n               *pgroups = eccurves_level2;\r\n               *pgroupslen = OSSL_NELEM(eccurves_level2);\r\n               break;\r\n            3: \r\n               *pgroups = eccurves_level3;\r\n               *pgroupslen = OSSL_NELEM(eccurves_level3);\r\n               break;\r\n            default:\r\n               *pgroups = eccurves_level1;\r\n               *pgroupslen = OSSL_NELEM(eccurves_level1);\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n```\r\nI'd actually also suggest to put the classic algorithms onto the same \"strength\" list(s): e.g., \"X25519\" on _level1, \"X448\" on _level2 (or 3) to permit running the whole openssl -- and all downstream apps at a specific strength level -- classic as well as PQ crypto."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-03-20T05:59:36Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Try to enlarge the stack in how all our subprojects are compiled so that they can be run (but then people might encounter this bad behaviour outside of our build)?\r\n\r\nAdvice welcome, @vsoftco @xvzcf @christianpaquin @thomwiggers @baentsch."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/601592783","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/671#issuecomment-601592783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/671","id":601592783,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTU5Mjc4Mw==","user":{"login":"thomwiggers","id":974662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NDY2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/974662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers","html_url":"https://github.com/thomwiggers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thomwiggers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-20T08:52:49Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T08:52:49Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"The large stack-usage of some implementations is a long-known problem but I also don't know how to get around it (without large amounts of engineering effort).

But I see a bigger issue now when looking at this code: With this, we really completely remove algorithms from `openssl` usage -- which isn't so great given what we currently have (the ability to run all candidates side by side, e.g., in performance as well as further downstream app tests, also against classic crypto of the same level).\r\n\r\nNo, we don't remove them fully from openssl usage.  They're just not the default algorithms.  You can run `openssl s_server -curves kyber1024 ...` and `openssl s_client -curves kyber1024 ...` and it will work fine.
