Also,\r\n\r\n- I think `CMakeLists.txt.in`should be in a `third_party/cpu_features/` folder, the way it's done [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/3rdparty/ffmpeg). \r\n- We should note the `cpu_features` commit we are using, so that each liboqs commit can be associated with a specific `cpu_features` commit that it is known to work with.\r\n\r\nThere is one more wrinkle. When the time comes when `cpu_features` has to be linked to liboqs, I think it would be best if we retrieved the values of the variables [here](https://github.com/google/cpu_features/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L143) (`CPU_FEATURES_HDRS` and `CPU_FEATURES_SRCS`) and directly built them as part of liboqs, rather than having to juggle two different libraries where one depends on the other.
