The example given with the internal TLS server/client designed for testing works like a charm, but if I wanted to choose a quantum algorithm for KEM/KEX say for a vpn, or generate the parameters to use one for a configuration file, there seems to be no way of doing this. With the OQS-Openssl_1.0.2 one can specify the ciphersuite and that takes care of it because in that version the ciphersuite definition includes the KEM/KEX, but in OpenSSL 1.1.1 KEM/KEX is no longer in the ciphersuite, and creating \"curves\" for the Qalgorithms using the OpenSSL API for EC is no go. \r\n\r\nEven the demos for nginx/curl/httpd do not mention how to choose one over the others. Could you please advice on how to do this?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-03-07T07:17:45Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
