I'm considering doing a little benchmark of the post quantum ciphers in a openssl playground (mainly kex & signature algorithms). I've tested the command line server that comes with the openssl server and generated a self signed certificate with the pq signature of choice. I could connect to this server via the  openssl s_client tool, which lets you specify with the -curves parameter the <KEX> algorithm. This option is not available with the s_time command, very handy when benchmarking TLS connections. How do I specifically force a KEX algorithm in the test server/client connection with s_time. Are there any workarounds that you might know?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/595604745","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/137#issuecomment-595604745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/137","id":595604745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NTYwNDc0NQ==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-06T05:17:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T05:17:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Available via [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl#performance-testing) (PR #155) and [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/tree/master/curl#performance-testing)"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-03-06T05:17:38Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
