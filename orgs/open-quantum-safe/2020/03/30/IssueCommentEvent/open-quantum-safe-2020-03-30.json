is to use it with the python3 wrappers **liboqs-python**, so after I clone the the project I ran the command `oqs/oqs.py` and it returns the following message `No liboqs shared libraries found`.\r\n\r\nI have very poor experience on installing/compiling libraries, would appreciate if anyone could help me or guide me to install liboqs successfully so i can use **liboqs-python**.\r\n\r\nThank
