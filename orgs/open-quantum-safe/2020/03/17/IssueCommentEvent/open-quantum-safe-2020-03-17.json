In my opinion, the only thing we can do is to completely stop detecting CPU extensions in CMake and go to #624. After that we can opt out of using `list_cpu_extensions.c` and build `cpu_features` as part of `liboqs`\r\n\r\nI understand we have to build `cpu_features` for `list_cpu_extensions.c`, and I do see `list_cpu_extensions.c`as a temporary workaround until we can move all feature detection into the code and out of CMake. Where I was going with this was that we could build `cpu_features` twice for now: the first time as a library to attach to `list_cpu_extensions.c`, and the second time as a set of object files to be compiled into liboqs.\r\n\r\n> @gadoofou87 @xvzcf I agree (no big surprise :-) What about this, then: Remove CPU feature detection in initial build (\"Debug\" BUILD_TYPE doesn't depend on/needs this, right?), build liboqs incl. cpu_features then (say in a `build_bootstrap` folder) and only _then_ use the remaining BUILD_TYPES (then enabled by `cpu_features` having been created in `build_bootstrap` by then)? I have the gut feeling that we'll need non-optimised object files for best portability anyway...\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, we get CPU information from the first Debug build of liboqs+cpu_features, which we then use to set the variables [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/src/oqsconfig.h.cmake#L12) for the second Optimized `liboqs` build?\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-03-17T18:10:24Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
