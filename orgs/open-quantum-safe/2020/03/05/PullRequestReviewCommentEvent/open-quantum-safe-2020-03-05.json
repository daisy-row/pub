Turns `-Werror` back on.\r\n\r\nI discovered three different types of warnings:\r\n\r\n1. Warnings that we should actually fixed.  These have been fixed.\r\n2. Warnings that are technically things that should be fixed if we're being really pedantic, but aren't worth changing.  (For example, an issue with how const is interpreted on typedef'd typedef'd datatypes in SIKE, or unused functions in the way SIKE includes files.)  These have been worked around by disabling those warnings in the relevant subdirectory (e.g., in SIKE's CMakeLists.txt, but not in the top-level CMakeLists.txt).\r\n3. Warnings that are bugs in the compiler.  (For example, how `{0}` is interpreted by gcc-4.9.)  These have been worked around by disabling those warnings in the relevant subdirectory.  For gcc-4.9, in fact one type of warning can't be disabled, so I have disabled `-Werror` on that subdirectory when running gcc-4.9.\r\n\r\nThe summary is that a small number of warnings on some versions of gcc have been disabled or do not trigger errors in a limited number of directories.  All warnings on clang should trigger build failures.","created_at":"2020-02-28T04:16:12Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T07:26:49Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afc114da845834c187fdaed86e95afc13db0138b","assignee":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/519feb8716312bb25ca20a71d063678e5c99a13b","head":{"label":"open-quantum-safe:ds-compiler-warnings","ref":"ds-compiler-warnings","sha":"519feb8716312bb25ca20a71d063678e5c99a13b","user":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/op
