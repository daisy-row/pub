With the OQS-Openssl_1.0.2 one can specify the ciphersuite and that takes care of it because in that version the ciphersuite definition includes the KEM/KEX, but in OpenSSL 1.1.1 KEM/KEX is no longer in the ciphersuite, and creating \"curves\" for the Qalgorithms using the OpenSSL API for EC is no go. \r\n\r\nEven the demos for nginx/curl/httpd do not mention how to choose one over the others.
