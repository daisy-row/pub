When approved, it will be used to import new upstream versions of `kyber` and `dilithium` (setting the corresponding environment variables listed in the `copy_from_pqclean.yml` file to the folders of the upstream repositories along the same lines as is done for a `PQClean` import). \r\n\r\nBut by no means this facility is restricted to those algorithms. The basic idea is to have `META.yml` files modelled on the ones used by `PQClean` within the upstream repositories: These contain \r\n- names of files to import\r\n- possible compile directives\r\n- possibly changed & properly namespace'd algorithm entry points  \r\n- possibly changed KATs. Any such KAT changes will be called out when running the new script variant to ensure library version bumps can be initiated.\r\n\r\nA more complete documentation of this will be added to [the Wiki](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Contributing-guide) when merged. Conceptually, this could be used to automatically introduce any new/changed algorithms provided the upstream code maintainer provides NIST-like APIs and these \".yml-import-drivers\".\r\n\r\nCCI [ran successfully here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/baentsch/liboqs/307/workflows/742d5394-1bd1-4acd-b89a-78e365753c40)\r\n\r\nAll files changed outside of `copy_from_pqclean` have the facility added to provide their own compile directives and to allow for their own versions of otherwise common includes (generated by new `copy_from_pqclean`).\r\n\r\nA minor correction is also done to `scripts/copy_from_pqclean/src/sig/sig.h/algs_length.fragment` to cater for the new number of algorithms not imported from PQClean.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-09T07:15:36Z","updated_at":"2020-07-15T19:41:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7050b8697b3e9d58c460ae53ab3a5566ddc3813d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/789/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/789/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/789/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/40e5705637aafdd58522aa6e6017fd8cfcc299b9","head":{"label":"baentsch:mb-importupstream","ref":"mb-importupstream","sha":"40e5705637aafdd58522aa6e6017fd8cfcc299b9","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":240836921,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDA4MzY5MjE=","name":"liboqs","full_name":"baentsch/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch/liboqs","description":"C
