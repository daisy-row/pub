When running them manually, it's always a SIGSEGV (core dump): Quick gdb runs show the error in functions like `OQS_KEM_bike1_l3_fo_decode`,  `EphemeralKeyGeneration_A_extended`, `oqs_kem_frodokem_976_aes_mul_add_sa_plus_e`). Unfortunately I couldn't dig deeper as `liboqs` build for release type `Debug` had these core dumps disappear :-(\r\n\r\nAs the latter point hits so many different algorithms I wonder whether the CI-Alpine image is somehow not in line with our prerequisites... so asking for feedback from @xvzcf whether you see something glaring wrong with [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers/blob/master/alpine/Dockerfile) and the below:\r\n```\r\n~/project/build # gcc -v\r\nUsing built-in specs.\r\nCOLLECT_GCC=gcc\r\nCOLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-alpine-linux-musl/9.2.0/lto-wrapper\r\nTarget: x86_64-alpine-linux-musl\r\nConfigured with: /home/buildozer/aports/main/gcc/src/gcc-9.2.0/configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --infodir=/usr/share/info --build=x86_64-alpine-linux-musl --host=x86_64-alpine-linux-musl --target=x86_64-alpine-linux-musl --with-pkgversion='Alpine 9.2.0' --enable-checking=release --disable-fixed-point --disable-libstdcxx-pch --disable-multilib --disable-nls --disable-werror --disable-symvers --enable-__cxa_atexit --enable-default-pie --enable-default-ssp --enable-cloog-backend --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,fortran,ada --disable-libssp --disable-libmpx --disable-libmudflap --disable-libsanitizer --enable-shared --enable-threads --enable-tls --with-system-zlib --with-linker-hash-style=gnu\r\nThread model: posix\r\ngcc version 9.2.0 (Alpine 9.2.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence only Draft PR for the time being.
