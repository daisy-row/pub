True, this could change again @baentsch, but at least that's in our control, and we would set these macros correctly. Nonetheless, agreed that adding lower and upper bounds would make this more robust. I'm a bit confused by the jinja formatting rules. @xvzcf, can you help to get the syntax right, `WHAT GOES HERE` to select the last KEM/sig? Can you access arrays by numerical index or only by string name? If only the latter, do I need to iterate over collection and \"remember\" the last alg seen, or is there a better way?\r\n\r\n```\r\n#define IS_OQS_OPENSSL_SIG_NID(a) ( (a >= NID_oqs_sig_default) && (a <= NID_{{ WHAT GOES HERE? }}) )\r\n```","created_at":"2020-07-21T14:18:07Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T14:18:07Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/225#discussion_r458132729","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/225","author_association":"NONE","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/comments/458132729"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/225#discussion_r458132729"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/225"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":15,"original_line":15,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":457769189},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/225","id":453758508,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDUzNzU4NTA4","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/225","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/225.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/225.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/225","number":225,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Added
