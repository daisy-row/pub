Without applying this patch successfully/without error message, you do not get QSC algorithm support added to your build (but the build succeeds -- until you try q QSC algorithm). This then explains all your problems.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-07-20T05:37:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
