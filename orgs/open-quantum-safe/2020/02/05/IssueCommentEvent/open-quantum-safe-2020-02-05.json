However, developing a more general solution runs into an issue with building using Clang. It seems that the build scripts specifically require GCC and disallow Clang. That's problematic because Clang is necessary to cross-compile for iOS and Android, as GCC doesn't include toolchains for those platforms. Is there a reason that liboqs requires GCC? Otherwise, I'll work on a more elegant way to allow building with Clang as well."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-02-05T02:22:26Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
