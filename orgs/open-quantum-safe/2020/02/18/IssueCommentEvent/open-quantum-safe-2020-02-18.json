I was able to compile for all major ABI's with no issue. In the 'add-cpu-extensions-flag.cmake' file, I had to comment out the 'try_run' command in order to compile for Android x86 architectures. It seems that it was trying to run tests without awareness that the build machine and the host machine are completely different. My app is developed in Xamarin Forms, so I'm working through some issues with the shared library not being found. I'll update when I know whether the libraries produced by the script actually function.\r\nAlso, once I finish that, I'll work on the iOS build. CMake definitely made the Android compilation way more straightforward, and it seems it'll do the same for iOS."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-02-18T23:44:18Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
