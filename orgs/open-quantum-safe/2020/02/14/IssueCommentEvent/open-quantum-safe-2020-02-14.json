I'll repeat this later on a 'clean' image. In any case, if you know of \"migration headaches\" for people with a running/'old' build-env/Makefiles, maybe a short 'clean-your-present-installation-to-get-cmake-to-work' HOWTO may be good?

(They are essentially pointed to the original signature in DllImport)~~\r\n[Update] I have found out that DllImport actually prepend \"lib\" into library names for linux and macOS. However, they have to be exact as in \"liboqs.so\" is not equals to \"liboqs.so.0.0.0\" As a result, the changes would just be [DllImport(\"oqs\")] instead. (If you want to support the versioning, AssemblyLoadContext would be needed)\r\n\r\n2. Changed target frameworks to netstandard1.2 and netstandard2.0 allowing different version of .Net Core and .Net framework version to use this library. (netstandard1.2 is added for compatibility with the existing test case for netcoreapp1.1)\r\n\r\n3. Removed prebuild event for all projects except test case to allow other OS to execute the new dotnet cli commands.\r\n\r\n4. Addition of some useful scripts that can be used for reference for building this project. (Consist of Windows, Linux and macOS variants)\r\n\r\n5. Updated documentation in README.md to have a slightly more verbose information on how to build the sample application and the wrapper.\r\n\r\nSample Application Tested on:\r\n- [x] Windows 10\r\n- [x] Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)\r\n- [x] macOS (Mojave)\r\n\r\nRelevant issues: #2 #10 "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/comments/586484212","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/pull/11#issuecomment-586484212","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/11","id":586484212,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjQ4NDIxMg==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-14T21:42:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T21:42:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks for the updates @jianmingyong.
