It uses the JavaCPP infrastructure to build the bindings. A few notes for those willing to give it a try:\r\n- The Linux bindings support the full API.\r\n- The Android bindings only support a subset of the API and are much trickier to build. They should be considered a WIP:\r\n  - [This patch](https://github.com/zugaldia/javacpp-presets/blob/master/liboqs/liboqs-cross.patch) enables cross-compilation.\r\n  - NDK doesn't come with OpenSSL, I'm using the binaries provided by [Teska Labs](https://teskalabs.com/blog/openssl-binary-distribution-for-developers-static-library).\r\n  - Unlike `configure-android` discussed above which uses `gcc`, I've only tested the latest NDK version with `clang`. \r\n  - `sig-picnic` needs to be disabled to avoid a compilation error.\r\n- Build instructions, including an example using qTesla, is available in the [README.md](https://github.com/zugaldia/javacpp-presets/tree/master/liboqs#the-helloworldtestjava-source-file).\r\n\r\nIt's interesting that, while the Linux bindings build rather smoothly, Android (via NDK) throws multiple compilations warnings and errors for some header files. If someone more familiar with the project wants to check out the setup, this is [the main script](https://github.com/zugaldia/javacpp-presets/blob/master/liboqs/cppbuild.sh) to review."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-02-07T04:48:03Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
