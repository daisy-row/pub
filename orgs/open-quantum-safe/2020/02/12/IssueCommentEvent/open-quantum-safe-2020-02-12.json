Addition of Lib_OQS_KEM_* and Lib_OQS_SIG_* methods for both Linux and macOS. (They are essentially pointed to the original signature in DllImport)\r\n2. Changed target frameworks to netstandard1.2 and netstandard2.0 allowing different version of .Net Core and .Net framework version to use this library. (netstandard1.2 is added for compatibility with the existing test case for netcoreapp1.1)\r\n3. Removed prebuild event for all projects except test case to allow other OS to execute the new dotnet cli commands.\r\n4. Addition of some useful scripts that can be used for reference for building this project. (Consist of windows and macOS variants)\r\n\r\nPending Changes: (To be tested)\r\n1. Attempt to replace Lib_OQS_KEM_* and Lib_OQS_SIG_* methods for AssemblyLoadContext \r\n2. Bump to minimum of netstandard1.5 (with little impact of compatibility)\r\n\r\n#2 #10 "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/comments/585028955","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/pull/11#issuecomment-585028955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/11","id":585028955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTAyODk1NQ==","user":{"login":"jianmingyong","id":7069939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjk5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7069939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong","html_url":"https://github.com/jianmingyong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T04:55:25Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T04:55:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I just noticed the dotnet core resolve file names for you.
