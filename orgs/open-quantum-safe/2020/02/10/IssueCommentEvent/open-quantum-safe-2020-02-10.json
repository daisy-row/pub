Secondly, now that I think more about it, I think we should allow other signature algorithms in the tool. Right now it's a choice between classical default or OQS sigs, but we might want to run our PQ KEMs with various classical sigs (FIPS certified, different sizes matching different KEMs security levels, etc.).

Could constitute new support obligations as this makes things trivial to (mis)use by ..... \"specialists\". But also could help questions asking for help building the system (along the lines, \"if you can't build stuff, use this image\"...\r\n\r\nYes.  As for pushing from CircleCI, it seems we get a variety of CPUs when using CircleCI, sometimes AVX512 sometimes not, so that might not be the best approach.  If one of us has an older machine (e.g., AVX2, AES-NI, but not much more) maybe we could use that?"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-02-10T18:59:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
