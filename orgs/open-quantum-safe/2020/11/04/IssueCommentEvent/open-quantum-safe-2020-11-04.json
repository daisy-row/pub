I was under the wrong impression that the liboqs SHAKE wrapper would use AVX2 under the hood if available. Without this optimization, the performance degrades noticeably even if the AVX2 x4 implementation is used where possible. I'm not yet sure what's easier, but the two options would be to either make the liboqs wrapper use the AVX2 implementation or also expose a Keccak code package style interface.\r\n\r\nThanks Sebastian. We'll take some time to review our internal common crypto code and see what's the best option for picnic. Again, we want to make sure we don't degrade the current performance.\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-11-04T22:43:08Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
