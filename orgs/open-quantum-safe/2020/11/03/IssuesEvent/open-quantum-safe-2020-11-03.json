I already compiled both, and it works fine with the classical ciphers, as expected. Now I would like to use one of the PQ KEM in the handshake process. The MQTT client APIs that use OpenSSL (Paho, mosquitto) only allow to specified the ciphers to use (e.g., ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA), but give no option for _groups_ or _curves_, used in the example _opnessl s_client_ given, and in other integrations (Chromium). Any suggestions of what can I do?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-11-03T05:27:50Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
