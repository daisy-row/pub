Let's reflect on the purpose of presenting it as a time series. I understand it serves two purposes: seeing how performance changed after important commits were merged, and providing a visual average over time (effectively adding more data points).\r\n\r\nAgreed. So what about adding a mechanism to selectively set dates that shall become part of the visualization export (encoded in [gen_website.sh](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/speed/blob/main/perf/scripts/gen_website.sh)? ) and which could be manually amended/checked in to github as and when substantial changes to the code base occur and as and when the current number of test runs shown becomes too large to derive meaningful insight from), e.g., a file containing a list of dates (instead of the single start date currently passed as parameter to the HTML-generator python script)? This would be a whitelist approach at the generating end (dropping data from export).\r\nAn alternative could be a simple \"pruning\" script deleting unwanted/redundant data/date points from the current daily exports, i.e., a blacklist approach that could be done at the receiving end (still retaining all data points without visualizing all of them). My preference would be on this, second option.\r\n@dstebila: Any preference?
