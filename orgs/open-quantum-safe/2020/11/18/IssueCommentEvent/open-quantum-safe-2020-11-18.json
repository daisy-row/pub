If we'd be able to set up proper CORS handling we could serve the HTML from www.openquantumsafe.org and the current test data from aws. Until then, this PR also generates a `site2.tgz` containing this logic and all data so the whole bundle can still be downloaded to a single site to avoid cross origin hassles.\r\nParticularly @dstebila @xvzcf please let me know what you think. The PR can also be streamlined if we scrap the old way of generating HTML/JS/JSON and only use this going forward.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/speed/issues/comments/729447556","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/speed/pull/17#issuecomment-729447556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/speed/issues/17","id":729447556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyOTQ0NzU1Ng==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-18T05:54:54Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T05:54:54Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Superseded by #18 ","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-11-18T05:54:55Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
