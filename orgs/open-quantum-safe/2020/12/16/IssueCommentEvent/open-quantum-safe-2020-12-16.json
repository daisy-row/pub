I will address the points you mentioned.\r\n\r\nCCI shows above that all tests passed, but if you look closely all BUT OpenSSH was tested. I registered a new job *ubuntu_x64_openssh* because I did not want to mess with your other tests you mention to be \"some kind of SSL-using\", which SSH is not. Why CCI did not automatically run the other job I don't know, on my side (CCI) it just did it. But I guess for simplicitiy's sake it is easier to add OpenSSH to the other tests and omit the fact that it is not SSL based. So it would be retested upon a change of OpenSSL with the others, which would not be the end  of the world.\r\n\r\nLong story short: Should I integrate the test job into your existing job or keep the new one I created?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-12-16T09:18:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/746725997","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-746725997","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":746725997,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NjcyNTk5Nw==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T17:53:48Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T17:53:48Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Should I integrate the test job into your existing job or keep the new one I created?\r\n\r\nOK you have a point.

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/747072885","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-747072885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":747072885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzA3Mjg4NQ==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-16T22:14:44Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T22:14:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I tried building the containers and connecting from the client to server; it worked without a glitch!","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-12-16T22:14:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
