building and running boringssl on the same platform that the other profiling tests are run, here are some observations:\r\n1) oqs-boringssl speed does not perform OQS crypto speed tests unlike oqs-openssl\r\n2) Classic crypto performance in boringssl is slower than openssl, e.g.:\r\n\r\n### openssl \r\n(from https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/visualization/openssl_speed_series.html)\r\n```\r\nrsa 2048 bits sign/s: 1533.00; verify/s 51018.50\r\nrsa 4096 bits sign/s: 226.50; verify/s: 14503.00\r\n253 bits EdDSA (Ed25519) sign/s: 25311.00; verify/s: 8216.50\r\n```\r\n\r\n### boringssl (execution on same AWS test platform):\r\n```\r\nDid 1428 RSA 2048 signing operations in 1015147us (1406.7 ops/sec)\r\nDid 40000 RSA 2048 verify (same key) operations in 1006660us (39735.4 ops/sec)\r\nDid 30000 RSA 2048 verify (fresh key) operations in 1015133us (29552.8 ops/sec)\r\nDid 216 RSA 4096

that boringssl is not as well tuned as openssl.
