The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:05:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:07:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:16:33Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:18:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:20:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:22:03Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions
