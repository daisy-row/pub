The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/745259307","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-745259307","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":745259307,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTI1OTMwNw==","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-15T12:32:28Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:32:28Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@xykro Thanks very much for this work (incl. the squashing -- makes it very readable) and the nice use case in USAGE.md! I also like very much the explanations and \"helpful hints\" if something goes wrong. I provided some suggestions for improvements above. Most notably, I'd be grateful for considering updates to the USAGE.md such that that can be cut-copy-pasted straight to DockerHub when everything builds OK within the OQS CCI chain (from where it shall be auto-pushed if all tests pass: You could actually retain the \"auto-push\" logic if you'd set the environment variable TARGETNAME within your CCI environment to a docker hub prefix you might control, e.g., \"fhnw-ise-qcrypt\" to have the exact same setup).\r\nFor a quick glance-over regarding the openssh-specifics would @xvzcf or @christianpaquin want to take a deeper look?","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-12-15T12:32:28Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
