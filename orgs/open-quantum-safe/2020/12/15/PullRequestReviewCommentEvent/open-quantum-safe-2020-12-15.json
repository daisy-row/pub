This is necessary as logging in as root in ssh is not recommended practice. But it is worth to note that this user, per default called `oqs`, is not set as the default user when the image starts (which would be done with `USER oqs` in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)). The reason for that is that the the start up script needs root permissions to generate all host keys and start the sshd service. This means that when executing a command as the user `oqs`, the `docker exec` command needs to be used together with the option `--user oqs`.\n+\n+\n+## Quick start \n+\n+How to set up your quantum-safe OpenSSH is described in the corresponding [README.md](README.md).\n+\n+## Limitations\n+\n+For limitations of the post-quantum algorithms themselves, refer to [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh#limitations-and-security).\n+\n+## Slightly more advanced usage options\n+\n+### Change install location\n+\n+The OQS-OpenSSH binaries, configuration files and host keys are located in the default install location `/opt/oqs-ssh/`. This location can be changed at build time with `--build-arg INSTALL_DIR=</path/to/new/location>`.\n+\n+### Access the man pages of oqs-ssh\n+\n+Man pages for oqs-ssh are installed in `<INSTALL_DIR>/share/man` and can be viewed by for example `man -l <INSTALL_DIR>/share/man/man1/ssh.1` or `man -l <INSTALL_DIR>/share/man/man5/ssh.5`. Note that those man pages are **not** different from the original ssh man pages. So it might be easier to consult them on your local system or the internet.

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:05:36Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

This is necessary as logging in as root in ssh is not recommended practice. But it is worth to note that this user, per default called `oqs`, is not set as the default user when the image starts (which would be done with `USER oqs` in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)). The reason for that is that the the start up script needs root permissions to generate all host keys and start the sshd service. This means that when executing a command as the user `oqs`, the `docker exec` command needs to be used together with the option `--user oqs`.\n+\n+\n+## Quick start \n+\n+How to set up your quantum-safe OpenSSH is described in the corresponding [README.md](README.md).\n+\n+## Limitations\n+\n+For limitations of the post-quantum algorithms themselves, refer to [this](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh#limitations-and-security).\n+\n+## Slightly more advanced usage options\n+\n+### Change install location\n+\n+The OQS-OpenSSH binaries, configuration files and host keys are located in the default install location `/opt/oqs-ssh/`. This location can be changed at build time with `--build-arg INSTALL_DIR=</path/to/new/location>`.\n+\n+### Access the man pages of oqs-ssh\n+\n+Man pages for oqs-ssh are installed in `<INSTALL_DIR>/share/man` and can be viewed by for example `man -l <INSTALL_DIR>/share/man/man1/ssh.1` or `man -l <INSTALL_DIR>/share/man/man5/ssh.5`. Note that those man pages are **not** different from the original ssh man pages. So it might be easier to consult them on your local system or the internet. \n+\n+Direct links to man pages: [ssh(1)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh), [sshd(8)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/sshd), [ssh_config(5)](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config), [sshd_config(5)](https://linux.die.net/man/5/sshd_config)\n+\n+## Seriously more advanced usage options\n+\n+### Choosing the algorithms\n+\n+For a list of all algorithms see [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh#supported-algorithms). It is recommended to only use hybrid algorithms to maintain established classical security. The post-quantum safe algorithms have not yet received enough confidence to be relied on as the only security mechanism.\n+\n+The image's default key-exchange algorithm is `ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024-sha384@openquantumsafe.org` for key-exchange with `curve25519-sha256` for backwards compatibility. For host and identity key (authentication) algorithms `ssh-p256-dilithium2` and classical `ssh-ed25519` are used. Those algorithms may be changed by adjusting the files `ssh_config` and `sshd_config` respectively. In the built image, those files are located at the default install location (see above). After changing something in `sshd_config`, the sshd must be restarted using `rc-service oqs-sshd restart`. Alternatively, the configuration can be changed **pre**-build by changing [ssh_config](ssh_config) or [sshd_config](sshd_config) and rebuilding the image.\n+\n+Be aware that configurations for sshd and for ssh can be different as long as you don't want to connect to localhost. For example can ssh be configured like a classical ssh client and sshd may support post-quantum algorithms only with no backwards compatibility at all.\n+\n+Note that as long as the backwards compatibility is maintained, the system can not be considered post-quantum safe for obvious reasons.\n+\n+### Key re-generation\n+\n+When the image is run normally (`docker run -it oqs-img -t oqs-ssh`) it invokes the script [key-regen.sh](key-regen.sh). It generates all host and identity keys that **do not exist** and **are necessary** according to the configuration files ([ssh_config](ssh_config) and [sshd_config](sshd_config)). Their necessity is determinded based on the following parameters:\n+1. `IdentityFile` for **identity keys**: For every entry (there may be multiple) the corresponding key is generated.\n+   - e.g. `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or\n+   - `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_p256_dilithium2`\n+2. `HostKeyAlgorithms` for **host keys**: For every algorithm listed a host key will be generated.\n+   - e.g. `HostKeyAlgorithms ssh-p256-dilithium2,ssh-ed25519`\n+\n+Note that the `key-regen.sh` script is executed as the `root` user.\n+\n+As mentioned above those keys will only be generated if they don't yet exist. So even though the script is executed every time a container is started (or run), it usually only does something the first time. If any host key was generated, the `sshd` service will be restarted.\n+\n+The location where `key-regen.sh` is looking for `ssh_config`/`sshd_config` is the install directory of `oqs-ssh`. The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) puts this location into the variable `OQS_INSTALL_DIR` where it will be accessible from the script.\n+## Using oqs-ssh for quantum-safe remote access with minimal intrusion\n+\n+One use case of quantum-safe ssh running in docker could be accessing a remote system without messing with its ssh(d) installation or other parts of the system you maybe don't want to interact with. This means minimal intrusion and everything can easily be removed again. This is done by running this docker image on said system and sharing its network space. Thus it is possible to access host ports from **within** the docker container. Normally, the use case of docker is one of isolation with some shared directories and published ports at max. So this solution works around the usual docker limitations.\n+\n+Additionally, it is advised to **change the default username and password** when building the image because your plan is to expose it to the world.\n+\n+```html\n+Structure of quantum-safe remote access using docker containers\n+\n++------------------+                +----------------------+\n+|      Client      |                |         Host         |\n+|  +------------+  |                |  +----------------+  |\n+|  |            |  |                |  |                |  |\n+|  |   Docker   +--------------------->+     Docker     |  |\n+|  |            |  |       Port 2222|  |                |  |\n+|  +------------+  |                |  +-------+--------+  |\n+|                  |                |          |           |\n++------------------+                |  Port 22 v           |\n+                                    |  +-------+--------+  |\n+                                    |  |                |  |\n+                                    |  |  sshd on host  |  |\n+                                    |  |                |  |\n+                                    |  +----------------+  |\n+                                    |                      |\n+                                    +----------------------+\n+```\n+### Set up the server (docker container on target-host)\n+\n+To start the ssh server, meaning the docker container on the host system, follow those instructions:\n+- Build the docker image as usual, change username and password\n+       \n+       docker build --build-arg OQS_USER=<my-desired-username> --build-arg OQS_PASSWORD=<my-desired-password> -t oqs-openssh-img .\n+- Run the docker image with\n+\n+       docker run -dit --network host --name oqs-ssh oqs-ssh-img\n+\n+- Or, if you want the container to automatically start with docker\n+\n+       docker run -dit --network host --name oqs-ssh --restart unless-stopped oqs-openssh-img\n+\n+The `--network host` option will attach the container directly to your host's network, sharing its IP.

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:16:33Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

You can hop on either of those two containers as a non-root user (oqs) to use the built-in OQS-OpenSSH binaries or do other shenanigans by typing\n+`docker exec -ti -u oqs oqs-openssh-server /bin/sh`\n+Of course adjust the container's name accordingly if hopping onto the client (==> `oqs-openssh-client`).","path":"openssh/README.md","position":15,"original_position":15,"commit_id":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","original_commit_id":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"again, suggest using a \"cut-copy-paste\" ready line instead of just 'oqs-openssh-client'","created_at":"2020-12-15T12:18:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:18:32Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#discussion_r543294683","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments/543294683"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#discussion_r543294683"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":15,"original_line":15,"side":"RIGHT"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65","id":540179821,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQwMTc5ODIx","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","number":65,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Added OQS-OpenSSH demo","user":{"login":"xykro","id":9986471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODY0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9986471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro","html_url":"https://github.com/xykro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Hi @baentsch and @dstebila\r\n\r\nReferring to issue #54. \r\n\r\nAs we talked about, we have (the [ISE institute](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-sensors-and-electronics) from [FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/en)) have created a docker demo image that uses your OQS-OpenSSH implementation.\r\n\r\nThe [README.md](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/openssh/README.md) contains setup and general information while the [USAGE.md](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/openssh/USAGE.md) describes some more advanced use cases, like using this demo to connect to a remote OQS-OpenSSH instance.\r\n\r\nI've added a new job for [CircleCI](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/.circleci/config.yml) for this demo image. The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:18:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","created_at":"2020-12-15T11:27:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:20:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c18574e5a7ff167c5bea60abc5ccb394cb66482","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/statuses/8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","head":{"label":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt:pull-request","ref":"pull-request","sha":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":299259879,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTkyNTk4Nzk=","name":"oqs-demos","full_name":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fhnw-ise-qcrypt","id":72196109,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjcyMTk2MTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/72196109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos","description":"Instructions

Run `docker build -t oqs-openssh-img .` This will generate the image with the name `oqs-openssh-img`\n+2. `docker run --name oqs-openssh-server -ditp 2222:2222 --rm oqs-openssh-img`\n+This will start a docker container that has sshd listening for SSH connections on port 2222 and this port is forwarded to and accessible via `localhost:2222`.\n+3. `docker run --rm --name oqs-openssh-client -dit oqs-openssh-img` will start a docker container with the same properties as `oqs-openssh-server` except the port 2222 is not published.\n+4. You can hop on either of those two containers as a non-root user (oqs) to use the built-in OQS-OpenSSH binaries or do other shenanigans by typing\n+`docker exec -ti -u oqs oqs-openssh-server /bin/sh`\n+Of course adjust the container's name accordingly if hopping onto the client (==> `oqs-openssh-client`).\n+\n+It is possible that the `docker build [...]` command fails with something like `Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket [...]`. That is because the active user is not a member of the `docker` group yet. To fix this run:\n+```bash\n+usermod -aG docker <user>\n+newgrp docker\n+```\n+The first command adds user `<user>` to the group `docker`, and the second simulates a logout/login, so you don't have to do a re-login.\n+\n+### Connect from container to container via OQS-SSH\n+\n+1. To connect to another docker container, we first need to create a docker network by typing `docker network create oqs-openssh-net`.\n+\n+1. Then connect the containers to this network by typing `docker network connect oqs-openssh-net <name-of-container>` where `<name-of-container>` is once the server's and once the client's name. Obviously this does not work if the containers are not yet running, in this case refer to the [Quick Start](README.md#quick-start) section.\n+\n+1. Then connect to the server by typing `docker exec -ti oqs-openssh-client ssh oqs@oqs-openssh-server` and authenticating the user `oqs` with its default password `oqs.pw`.\n+\n+As server and client are based on the same image, connecting from the server to the client's ssh daemon is possible as well. For that use the same command and exchange `server` and `client`.\n+\n+## More details\n+\n+The Dockerfile \n+- obtains all source code required for building the quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) algorithms and the [QSC-enabled version of OpenSSH (7.9-2020-08_p1)](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/releases/tag/OQS-OpenSSH-snapshot-2020-08)\n+- builds all libraries and applications\n+- by default starts the openssh daemon\\*\n+- creates a second user `oqs` with the default password `oqs.pw`\n+- by default creates host keys based on the enabled host key algorithms in `sshd_config`\\*\n+- by default creates identity keys based on the config file `ssh_config`\\*\n+\n+\\*those steps are executed when the image is startet.","path":"openssh/README.md","position":44,"original_position":44,"commit_id":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","original_commit_id":"8d34dd79bccb21905264af15d136e2b4fc2e6741","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"typo: \"startet\" -> \"started\"","created_at":"2020-12-15T12:22:02Z","updated_at":"2020-12-15T12:22:03Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#discussion_r543296799","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/comments/543296799"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#discussion_r543296799"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":44,"original_line":44,"side":"RIGHT"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pulls/65","id":540179821,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQwMTc5ODIx","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","number":65,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Added OQS-OpenSSH demo","user":{"login":"xykro","id":9986471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODY0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9986471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro","html_url":"https://github.com/xykro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xykro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Hi @baentsch and @dstebila\r\n\r\nReferring to issue #54. \r\n\r\nAs we talked about, we have (the [ISE institute](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/about-fhnw/schools/school-of-engineering/institutes/institute-for-sensors-and-electronics) from [FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/en)) have created a docker demo image that uses your OQS-OpenSSH implementation.\r\n\r\nThe [README.md](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/openssh/README.md) contains setup and general information while the [USAGE.md](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/openssh/USAGE.md) describes some more advanced use cases, like using this demo to connect to a remote OQS-OpenSSH instance.\r\n\r\nI've added a new job for [CircleCI](https://github.com/fhnw-ise-qcrypt/oqs-demos/blob/pull-request/.circleci/config.yml) for this demo image. The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are
