The test it does is connecting to itself (localhost) using chosen PQC algorithms via OQS-SSH. Defaults are p256-dilithium2 and ecdh-nistp384-kyber-1024, chosen more or less randomly. Those algorithms may be changed by passing the SIG and/or KEM variables to the docker run command.\r\nReturn code is 0 if the connection to localhost using the ubkey method was successful, 1 otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have **not** added OQS-OpenSSH to the \"Push all images\" step, I reckoned as you will be hosting the image I'll let you set that up properly.\r\n\r\nGit history is squashed down to 1 commit, I do not want to bring my mess over :-)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any adjustments are required.","performed_via_github_app":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/747668300","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/pull/65#issuecomment-747668300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/65","id":747668300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NzY2ODMwMA==","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-17T20:00:04Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T20:00:04Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> I handled most of you request/applied most of the things I'd do.
