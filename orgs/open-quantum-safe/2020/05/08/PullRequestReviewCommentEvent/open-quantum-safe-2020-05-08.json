The function should rather be called `tls1_get_server_supported_groups` as it's creating a deviation from standard-OpenSSL functionality (to treat server and client side curve list identically). \r\nWhat I find 'suboptimal' is that only one occurrence of the call to the original `tls1_get_supported_groups` is replaced in this file and not both. Why?\r\nIf I don't understand things wrong, this is another consequence of the decision to reduce the number of curves announced causing ever more changes (and this code now effectively tries to roll back this decision only for the server). Should we possibly revisit _that decision_ instead? OR introduce a true OQS algorithm selection mechanism instead of \"abusing\" EC curves? I have the gut feeling that this might also be the reason for #179 (where a plain (EC) s_server seems to be run against an OQS/kyber512 client). It definitely was the reason for #172 and #173 ...","created_at":"2020-05-08T04:54:54Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T04:54:54Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180#discussion_r421937297","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/180","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/comments/421937297"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180#discussion_r421937297"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/180"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":656,"original_line":656,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":421756355},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/180","id":414842704,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE0ODQyNzA0","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/180","number":180,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Overhauled test suite.","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"The speed tests have been temporarily taken out the CI.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by \"roll back\": the server was advertising a reduced set of groups even before this change, and I did not seek to alter that behaviour. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this change was for the server to obtain the shared group from a larger set of all the supported groups rather than the pared-down set returned by `tls1_get_supported_groups` (which is used to populate the ClientHello and ServerHello). This means that, for example, when the client specifies `-curves frodo640aes`, with this change, the server gets its shared groups from the larger set, and correctly settles on `frodo640aes` for the rest of the handshake. Prior to the change, the server would've gotten its supported groups from the smaller list returned by `tls1_get_supported_groups`, which would've resulted in an error since `frodo640aes` would not be on that list.","created_at":"2020-05-08T16:03:49Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T16:03:49Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180#discussion_r422227851","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/180","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/comments/422227851"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180#discussion_r422227851"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/180"}},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":656,"original_line":656,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":421756355},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pulls/180","id":414842704,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE0ODQyNzA0","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/180.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/180","number":180,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Overhauled test suite.","user":{"login":"xvzcf","id":21228961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjI4OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf","html_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xvzcf/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"The speed tests have been temporarily taken out the CI.
