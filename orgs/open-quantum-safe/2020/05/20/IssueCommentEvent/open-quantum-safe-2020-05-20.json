about merging the summary and implementation sections into a single not-too-big summary section on top? Here's a stab at merging them (justification comes after)\r\n\r\n# FrodoKEM (https://frodokem.org/) \r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n- **Algorithm type**: key encapsulation mechanism\r\n- **Main cryptographic assumption**: learning with errors (LWE)\r\n- **Scheme authors**: Michael Naehrig, Erdem Alkim, Joppe Bos, Léo Ducas, Karen Easterbrook, Brian LaMacchia, Patrick Longa, Ilya Mironov, Valeria Nikolaenko, Christopher Peikert, Ananth Raghunathan, Douglas Stebila\r\n- **Version**: NIST Round 2 submission\r\n- **Implementation:** https://github.com/Microsoft/PQCrypto-LWEKE/commit/d5bbd0417ba111b08a959c0042a1dcc65fb14a89\r\n- **Implementation Constant-time?**: Yes\r\n- **Implementation Notes:** MIT License, Portable C with optional use (selected at compile-time) of AVX2 and AESNI instructions\r\n\r\n... followed by the parameter set table.\r\n\r\n# Justification\r\n\r\nI don't see the need to repeat `kem_frodokem` in the header since the filename is already `kem_frodokem.md`. We can instead use the heading to convey the **Name** and **Authors' website** fields. If we also split the `docs/algorithms` directory into something like `docs/kem_datasheets`/`docs/kex_datasheets` and `docs/sig_datasheets`, we can remove the `algorithm datasheet` text from the heading and the `kem` and `sig` prefixes from the files.\r\n\r\nI merged **Source of implementation** and **Implementation version** into one **Implementation** field. This field points to the location of the commit, which can also be the source of the implementation. I've moved everything besides the **Constant-time** field into a single **Implementation Notes** field, as I thought (comparatively speaking) they weren't as important as the preceding two fields."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-05-20T18:23:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
