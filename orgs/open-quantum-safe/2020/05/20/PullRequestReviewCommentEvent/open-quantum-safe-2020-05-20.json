From the project root directory, the following test suites can be executed:\n \n-Alternatively, to log the run.sh output while following live, try:\n+- The \"basic\" TLS test suite: This sets the server signature algorithm to `oqs_sig_default` and establishes a TLS connection for each key-exchange algorithm, and which subsequently sets server key-exchange algorithm to `oqs_kem_default` and establishes a TLS connection for each signature algorithm, can be run by executing the following command:\n \n-    ./run.sh | tee `date \"+%Y%m%d-%Hh%Mm%Ss-openssl.log.txt\"`\n-\t\n-### Running using CircleCI\n+```\n+python3 -m pytest oqs-test/test_tls_basic.py\n+```\n \n-You can locally run any of the integration tests that CircleCI runs.  First, you need to install CircleCI's local command line interface as indicated in the [installation instructions](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/).  Then:\n+- The \"full\" TLS test suite, which tests TLS connections for all possible pairs of signature and key-exchange algorithms and can be run by executing the following command:\n+\n+```\n+python3 -m pytest oqs-test/test_tls_full.py\n+```\n+\n+- A CMS test suite, which tests the CMS functionality for all signature algorithms and can be run by executing the following command:\n+\n+```\n+python3 -m pytest oqs-test/test_cms.py\n+```\n+\n+Note that all the above test suites can be parallelized using `pytest-xdist`'s `--numprocesses` option.\n+\n+## Running using CircleCI\n+\n+You can locally run any of the integration tests that CircleCI runs.  First, you need to install CircleCI's local command line interface as indicated in the [installation instructions](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/).
