Should we mark all of the external files with their respective license, if not, why not? \r\n\r\nI think of 'external' and 'pqclean' files as being added to our repo without being touched by human hands, and I don't want to have to modify all of those files and make them inconsistent with upstream changes.  That's certainly the case for pqclean.

I added a unit test that checks that every .c, .h, .s, .S, .py, and various CMake files all have SPDX headers, except for files in the pqclean and external directories.  However, it does not check what license is present, just that the header is present (i.e., it is not automatically checking that no incompatibly licensed files are added); that will still be manual.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to see the proposed [coding conventions](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Coding-conventions) update before finishing this review.\r\n\r\nI've added it to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Coding-conventions and https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Contributing-guide."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-05-12T00:50:04Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

But then... `docs`! Never ran `gen_docs` either :-)\r\n\r\nMay I thus suggest a (more prominent) link to them, maybe from the License section? And/or the [Algorithms supported](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs#supported-algorithms section)? \r\n\r\nThe liboqs License section itself might be simplified then by stating MIT as the baseline license and the intention to not have code licensed incompatible with MIT (e.g., GNU or proprietary) to be included -- and then remove all line items presently listed: That should stop 'unwelcome' contributions and maybe motivate keen observers to notify us of such 'incompatibilities' without us having to take responsibility for documenting (again) which license rules which algorithm.\r\n\r\nTo your questions: \r\n- I like provenance information (as perfectly exemplified for LEDA: exact version, immediate upstream repo and ultimate upstream repo), so I'd vote to keep this -- and possibly extend it for all algorithms (e.g., we presently have PQClean Kyber which is not the ultimate upstream for Kyber).\r\n- I agree, reference to 'master' (and programming language) can be removed\r\n- For possible optimisations, I'd refer to the `oqsconfig.h` file to keep documentation up-to-date as code evolves: something along these lines maybe: \r\n\r\n> When optimised versions of the algorithm(s) are available this is documented by processor-specific extensions to the `oqsconfig.h` #defines generated during build. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I wonder whether it needs the 'added to liboqs by' section.\r\n\r\nAlso, repeating myself, I'd suggest to remove the explicit 'License' line item and rather augment the line item \"Author's website\" with \"Author's website and license information: \" [Link]. Together with the suggested [README.md#license](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs#license) simplification suggested above, this should deal with license 'review' once and for all.\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-05-12T05:27:01Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
