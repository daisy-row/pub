Before doing that, we should identify which things merit manual checking.  We don't have a specification of what things should be present in the file.  So I'm looking for some discussion in this issue about what to include.\r\n\r\n- What is the difference between 'source of implementation' and 'implementation version' -- do we need both or is one sufficient?\r\n- Check that the license is indeed correct.\r\n- Probably don't need a language field, everything is C or C + assembly.\r\n- 'Architectures supported in liboqs master branch' should be updated:\r\n  - The language 'liboqs master branch' is old (to back when we also had nist-branch) and should be removed\r\n  - This should be where we report what types of optimizations etc can be built (avx2, bmi, etc.).
