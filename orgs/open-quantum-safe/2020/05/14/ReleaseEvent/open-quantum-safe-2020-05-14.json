More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **OpenSSH 7.9 portable 1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into SSH in our fork of OpenSSH 7.9; see the [OQS-master](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh-portable/tree/OQS-master) branch of our OpenSSH fork's repository.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/thales-e-security/goliboqs\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is release candidate 1 for version 0.3.0 of liboqs.  This release candidate was released on May 14, 2020.  Its release page on GitHub is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.3.0-rc1.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.2.0 release of liboqs.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- BIKE: Update to Round 2 submission; removes `BIKE2-*`, `BIKE3-*`, `BIKE1-L5`, renames `BIKE1-L1` and `BIKE1-L3` to `BIKE1-L1-CPA` and `BIKE1-L3-CPA`, and adds `BIKE1-L1-FO` and `BIKE-L3-FO`\r\n- Classic McEliece: Newly added\r\n- Kyber: Add \"90s variants\": `Kyber512-90s`, `Kyber768-90s`, `Kyber1024-90s`\r\n- LEDAcrypt: Newly added\r\n- ThreeBears: Newly added\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Falcon: Newly added\r\n- MQDSS: Update to v2.1\r\n- Picnic: Update to v2.2\r\n- qTesla: Update to v1.0\r\n- Rainbow: Newly added\r\n- SPHINCS+: Add AVX2 and AESNI implementations\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Switch build system to CMake\r\n- Add support for building via Mingw on Windows\r\n- Support cross compilation via CMake to Raspberry Pi, Android, Windows, and more\r\n- Most optimizations dependent on specific CPU features are automatically detected at runtime, rather than being selected at compile-time\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-05-14T21:39:23Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
