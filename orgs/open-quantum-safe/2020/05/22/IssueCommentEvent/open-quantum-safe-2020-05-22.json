All `oqs-demos` now build on Alpine for reasons of size, so why not also test it? Or is the idea that `oqs-demos` implicitly then tests Alpine? :-)\r\n\r\nPreviously the amount of time the CircleCI tests were taking (in OpenSSL for example) was a concern, but we can probably revisit that.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-05-22T15:48:30Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
