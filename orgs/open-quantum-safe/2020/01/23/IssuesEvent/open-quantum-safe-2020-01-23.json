I'm considering doing a little benchmark of the post quantum ciphers in a openssl playground (mainly kex & signature algorithms). I've tested the command line server that comes with the openssl server and generated a self signed certificate with the pq signature of choice. I could connect to this server via the  openssl s_client tool, which lets you specify with the -curves parameter the <KEX> algorithm. This option is not available with the s_time command, very handy when benchmarking TLS connections. How do I specifically force a KEX algorithm in the test server/client connection with s_time.
