More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.\r\n\r\n**liboqs-python** is an open source Python 3 wrapper for the liboqs C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms. Details about liboqs-python can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/blob/master/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis release of liboqs-python was released on January 22, 2020. Its release page on GitHub is https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/releases/tag/0.2.1.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the third release of liboqs-python. \r\n\r\nThis release added partial support for RNGs from `<oqs/rand.h>`, together with a signature example and an RNG example.\r\n\r\nFor a list of changes see [CHANGES.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/blob/master/CHANGES.txt).\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-01-23T01:58:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
