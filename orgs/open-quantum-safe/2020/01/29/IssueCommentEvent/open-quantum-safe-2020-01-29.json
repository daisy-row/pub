Addition of Lib_OQS_KEM_* and Lib_OQS_SIG_* methods for both Linux and macOS. (They are essentially pointed to the original signature in DllImport)\r\n2. Changed target frameworks to netstandard1.2 and netstandard2.0 allowing different version of .Net Core and .Net framework version to use this library. (netstandard1.2 is added for compatibility with the existing test case for netcoreapp1.1)\r\n3. Addition of \"System.Collections.Immutable\" via nuget just to resolve dependencies available only on .Net Core and .Net framework without having to change anything. The alternative is to use IReadOnlyCollection interface instead.\r\n4. Removed prebuild event. Even though it seems useful but it isnâ€™t really that great if the user only want to target other OS other than windows.\r\n\r\nThis update would enable a wider range of support and possibly able upload to nuget.\r\n\r\nSample and Test project remain untouched.\r\n\r\n#2 #10 "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/comments/579584499","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/pull/11#issuecomment-579584499","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/11","id":579584499,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3OTU4NDQ5OQ==","user":{"login":"jianmingyong","id":7069939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjk5Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7069939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong","html_url":"https://github.com/jianmingyong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jianmingyong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-29T04:20:55Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T04:20:55Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I found out that it is hard to build the project on other operating system because of the sample application with the prebuild event using \"copy\" which won't exist in macOS bash context. \r\n\r\nIn my personal test branch, I have removed the prebuild event and testing the new dotnet CLI build instructions so any operating system could build and use directly.
