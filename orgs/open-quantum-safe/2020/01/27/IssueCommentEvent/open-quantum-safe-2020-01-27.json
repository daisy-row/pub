Addition of Lib_OQS_KEM_* and Lib_OQS_SIG_* methods for both Linux and macOS. (They are essentially pointed to the original signature in DllImport)\r\n2. Changed target frameworks to netstandard1.2 and netstandard2.0 allowing different version of .Net Core and .Net framework version to use this library. (netstandard1.2 is added for compatibility with the existing test case for netcoreapp1.1)\r\n3. Addition of \"System.Collections.Immutable\" via nuget just to resolve dependencies available only on .Net Core and .Net framework without having to change anything. The alternative is to use IReadOnlyCollection interface instead.\r\n4. Removed prebuild event. Even though it seems useful but it isnâ€™t really that great if the user only want to target other OS other than windows.\r\n\r\nThis update would enable a wider range of support and possibly able upload to nuget.\r\n\r\nSample and Test project remain untouched.\r\n\r\n#2 #10 "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/comments/578971872","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/pull/11#issuecomment-578971872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet/issues/11","id":578971872,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODk3MTg3Mg==","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-27T21:52:37Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T21:52:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks @jianmingyong! I am not very familiar with .NET so I'll wait to hear from my colleague Christian about the code.  It passes our Windows tests, which is good!  Have you successfully tested this on Linux or macOS?  If so, can you put the instructions for doing so in the README.md file? Then I will try running it on my Mac."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-01-27T21:52:38Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
