I've built envoy on everything from a local (reasonably fast) machine to an AWS cloud instance, and it's always been painful.\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to think of a way to get around this, as the circleci needs to test whether envoy will build with the updated versions of the openssl-oqs suite, right? The envoy [dockerfiles](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/ci/Dockerfile-envoy) copy the already built binary, and therefore save space that way. However, this does not help us speed up the actual build-from-source process.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could [change the build command](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/bazel/README.md#additional-envoy-build-and-test-options) from `bazel build -c opt envoy` to `bazel build -c fastbuild envoy` ?
