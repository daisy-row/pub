The consequence of which is that all Sphincs+ tests are gone because oqs-openssl111 only activates \"robust\" variants.\r\n\r\nSo before declaring this Ready for Review, @christianpaquin here's the question: Do we want to (also/alternatively) enable \"simple\" Sphincs+ variants in oqs-openssl111 instead? Upstream or only in profiling? Or shall we keep the \"robust\" variants as before (knowing they won't be standardized)?","created_at":"2023-01-22T13:29:40Z","updated_at":"2023-01-22T13:29:40Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/86/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/86/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/86/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/statuses/6c959badbcb8c6b6566e6c2ee3e84afaebb7bef2","head":{"label":"open-quantum-safe:mb-hybridkemhandshakes","ref":"mb-hybridkemhandshakes","sha":"6c959badbcb8c6b6566e6c2ee3e84afaebb7bef2","user":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":288761656,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODg3NjE2NTY=","name":"profiling","full_name":"open-quantum-safe/profiling","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling","description":"Network-level
