The benefit is that monitoring/logging can not only report the protocol and ciphers, but also the curve and certificate type used for a TLSv1.3 connection on the client side. In particular, an user can verify that a quantum-safe-crypto curve and certificate was used.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your pull request.
