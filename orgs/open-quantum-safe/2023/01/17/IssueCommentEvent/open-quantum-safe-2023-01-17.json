Once final standards emerge for the algorithms in liboqs, we will use those standards.  It is possible to have cryptographic libraries certified against standards (e.g., FIPS validation); we don't have plans for that at this point.\r\n\r\nRegarding auditing: we haven't had liboqs audited, and there isn't too much point in doing so while the algorithm specifications are not finalized.  It's something we'll keep in mind for later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1386074080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-17T21:28:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
