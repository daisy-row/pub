@baentsch Two questions:\r\n> \r\n>     1. OQS_CODEPOINT_X448_KYBER768=65073\r\n>        Is it on purpose to use OQS_CODEPOINT_X448_KYBER768 for x25519_kyber768?\r\nYes, absolutely: Check the code changes for the \"CLOUDFLARE\" define: As Cloudflare chose to mix the (cryptographically too weak) X25519 with Kyber768, the PR just changes the assignment --for this particularly weird/unlogical choice-- of X25519 to/with Kyber768. OQS in contrast recommends the use of combining classic and PQ algorithms of the same cryptographic strength. So, for a Kyber768 hybrid that is X448, hence the use of that define to change the codepoint of the Kyber768 hybrid. It may be confusing, but I wanted to add as little code as possible to support an unlogical and proprietary hybrid algorithm choice.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> In RFC draft, https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446, it mentioned 4 hybrid examples /* Hybrid Key Exchange Methods */ x25519_kyber768(TBD), secp384r1_kyber768(TBD), x25519_kyber512(TBD), secp256r1_kyber512(TBD), ..., Can we add secp384r1_kyber768 and secp256r1_kyber512 as well?\r\n> \r\n> Thanks\r\nI'm confused: The referenced RFC draft does not mention any of these algorithms. Besides, why should \"secp384r1_kyber768 and secp256r1_kyber512\" be added as they are already on the list you mention before?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1374385604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-01-07T05:42:16Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
