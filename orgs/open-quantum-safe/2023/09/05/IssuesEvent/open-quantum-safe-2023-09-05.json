Install oqsprovider on stock Ubuntu 22.04\r\n2. Add `ssl_ecdh_curve x25519_kyber768:p384_kyber768;` to nginx's config.\r\n3. Run `openssl s_client -tls1_3 -groups x25519_kyber768:p384_kyber768 example.com:443`\r\n4. No errors, successful connection\r\n4.5. If `ssl_ecdh_curve` does not contain `x25519_kyber768` and `p384_kyber768` neither, then `s_client` errors out.\r\n5. Try the same with a browser (Edge with p384_kyber768 enabled or Chrome with x25519_kyber768 enabled). X25519 is negotiated instead. (https://pq.cloudflareresearch.com/ shows working support for Chrome)\r\n\r\nThis would indicate that the provider works when requested but Chrome/Edge *just* don't? \r\n\r\nMaybe this is a trivial caveat I've missed reading through other issues, if so please do let me know.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCompleting oqsprovider installation and allowing the KeXs will make it possible for latest Edge and Chrome to utilize those KeXs.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: `Ubuntu 22.04`\r\n - OpenSSL version: `OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022)`\r\n - oqsprovider version: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/cc3895f208730abfe1efc15f7c3ff4358ac6e4c0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-05T22:38:12Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
