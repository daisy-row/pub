From a \"code logic\" perspective it is very clean. The reason why I didn't do it from the start was that I'm not sure what the OpenSSL core will do with this: If it is _guaranteed_ calling `sign` (without digest) when no digest has been specified (e.g., when requesting certificate generation), we'd be \"safe\" from an implication that I was always concerned with, namely (lack of) interoperability: The way things are now are exactly as they had been working on OQS-OpenSSL111 and that some [interop tests](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/pqc-certificates) expect.\r\n\r\n(Always) doing a digest (if indeed needed) \"under the hood\" surely would require a different OID (as the output changes) -- but this (matching hash strength with PQ alg strength) still is more manageable than the proposal in #239 where _any_ hash-and-sign algorithm combination (with _loads_ of OIDs) was proposed.\r\n\r\nSo the question seems to be whether it is possible to drive OpenSSL to create \"hash-free\" certificates without the need to handle the \"mdname==NULL\" case in \"digest_sign\". In the back of my mind, I think the answer is \"No\" -- but it would be good if you'd take another look.\r\n\r\nFinally, not really being a cryptographer, I felt \"uncomfortable\" silently adding a non-PQ algorithm (even if it's only hashing) invisibly in front of an otherwise \"pure\" PQ algorithm (designed to not need this). But that concern is one that @dstebila or @cryptojedi may help \"put to bed\": Feedback welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1706725296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-05T14:24:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
