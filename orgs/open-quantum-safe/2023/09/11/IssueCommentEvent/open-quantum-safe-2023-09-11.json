But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

Should I make a fix in this PR, or is it better to make a PR in pqclean and update here?\r\n\r\nI would say it's better to fix it in PQClean and then run `copy_from_upstream` again, but there's been some unrelated activity in PQClean since your initial two commits, and we presumably wouldn't want to pull that in at the same time. So I'm unsure. Thoughts on this @dstebila?\r\n\r\nEither way, it's probably best if you can get CI to pass on this branch before making a PR in PQClean, since the CI over there evidently didn't complain about the type confusion. It will save having to iterate through the process again if another build error sneaks in.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1714415976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-11T18:55:21Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
