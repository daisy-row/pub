But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

The algorithms appear to match apart from one minor difference, which can lead to different KAT and signatures in a \"literal\" implementation of the draft. This might be relevant for interop. I'd therefore tend to state, for example, \"FIPS 204 (Draft, August 24, 2023), implemented by pq-crystals/standard\" (for spec-version, if we do this in liboqs).

But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following
