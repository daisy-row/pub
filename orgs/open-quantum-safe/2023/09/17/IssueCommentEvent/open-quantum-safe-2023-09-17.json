Just one question: Why did VS CI tests pass even without this PR (separating the libs by \" \")? Can you point to some documentation requiring the \";\"as per this improvement? I'm approving as I don't have any real experience with VS development and assume you do have more.\r\n\r\nI did search the cmake doc and found out a more conventional way to fix the issues. The problem is probably caused by the string in\r\n```cmake\r\nset(OQS_ADDL_SOCKET_LIBS \"ws2_32.lib gdi32.lib crypt32.lib\")\r\n```\r\nThe previous code forced cmake into thinking the three libraries as a whole. The later as below followed the cmake normal syntax (recommended).\r\n```cmake\r\nset(OQS_ADDL_SOCKET_LIBS ws2_32.lib gdi32.lib crypt32.lib)\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1722535241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-17T18:19:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
