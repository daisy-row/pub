This is down to using `rpi_tools` for linking (pretty much required to build this for armv6), but unfortunately this only provides gcc v4.9.3 which is too low a version to compile OQS, so I end up with a mixed toolchain. As a result, cmake thinks these symbols will be available during link time, but they're not.\r\n\r\nIt appears the code caters for this eventuality, and contains both checks and fallback code depending on whether `OQS_HAVE_GETENTROPY` and `OQS_HAVE_EXPLICIT_BZERO` are defined. There's even a mechanism to switch these values to ON /defined, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to _undefine_ these. \r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I'm now patching CMakeLists.txt by commenting out the symbol checks:\r\n```\r\n# patch CMakeLists file so \"getentropy\" and \"explicit_bzero\" are undefined\r\nsed -i 's/check_symbol_exists[\\(]getentropy/#check_symbol_exists(getentropy/' src/common/CMakeLists.txt\r\nsed -i 's/check_symbol_exists[\\(]explicit_bzero/#check_symbol_exists(explicit_bzero/' src/common/CMakeLists.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows me to complete my builds, but I'd much rather do this via an environment variable or \r\n`-DOQS_HAVE_GETENTROPY=OFF` / `-DOQS_HAVE_EXPLICIT_BZERO=OFF` settings. Sadly this doesn't work.\r\n\r\nBoth code snippets use `#if defined(....)`, perhaps this could check for the value of the variables instead?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-07T10:59:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
