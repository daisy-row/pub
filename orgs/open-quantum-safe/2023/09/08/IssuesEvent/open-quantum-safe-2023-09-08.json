Console openssl with oqsprovider can work with them without any issues.\r\n\r\nIn the software (using OpenSSL API), I was having issues with populating config values, proper keys, etc. But now, I'm stuck at function `TS_RESP_create_response`, which trows multiple OPENSSL errors (the software obtains them by repeatedly calling ERR_get_error() and printing them):\r\n```\r\nLOG_DEBUG. : OpenSSL exception: 'error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type'\r\nLOG_DEBUG  : OpenSSL exception: 'error:17800076:time stamp routines::pkcs7 add signature error'\r\nLOG_DEBUG  : OpenSSL exception: 'error:17800079:time stamp routines::response setup error'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to fix that by running this code before-hand (with `#include <openssl/provider.h>`):\r\n```\r\nOSSL_PROVIDER *oqsprovider;\r\n\r\noqsprovider = OSSL_PROVIDER_load(NULL, \"oqsprovider\");\r\nif (oqsprovider == NULL) {\r\n    printf(\"Failed to load Legacy provider\\n\");\r\n    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (ERR_get_error() == 0){\r\n    uts_logger(ct, LOG_DEBUG, \"no openssl error\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nprintf(\"Successfully loaded provider\\n\");\r\n```\r\n, which runs successfully (I see both `no openssl error` and `Successfully loaded provider` in the output. But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: docker minideb\r\n - OpenSSL version: 3.2.1\r\n - oqsprovider version: 0.5.1\r\n\r\nPlease run the following commands to obtain the version information:\r\n - For OpenSSL: `openssl version`: `OpenSSL 3.1.2 1 Aug 2023 (Library: OpenSSL 3.1.2 1 Aug 2023)`\r\n - For oqsprovider: `openssl list -providers`: already posted here\r\n\r\nHere is the certificate of a public key, associated with the private key used for signing. I won't post private key here even if it is just a testing value, but I checked it's ASN1 structure and it's just regular `PrivateKeyInfo` with `1.3.6.1.4.1.2.267.7.8.7` algorithm and 7456B octet string. Also, as I said, console openssl does not have issues working with this key.\r\n\r\nIs there something I'm missing? Is this even an issue related to OQSProvider?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-08T14:40:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
