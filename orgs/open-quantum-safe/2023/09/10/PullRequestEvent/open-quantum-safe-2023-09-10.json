This removes a possible failure mode of liboqs on Apple platforms with `getentropy()`.\r\n\r\nThe man page for `getentropy()` on MacOSX also discourages its use\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, it should be noted that getentropy() is primarily intended for use in the construction and seeding of userspace PRNGs like\r\n     arc4random(3) or CC_crypto(3).  Clients who simply require random data should use arc4random(3), CCRandomGenerateBytes() from\r\n     CC_crypto(3), or SecRandomCopyBytes() from the Security framework instead of getentropy() or random(4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn iOS we currently use SecRandomCopyBytes() this requires linking to the Security framework and the call can fail. We have run into issues with this call failing so we propose using `arc4random_buf()` as it can never fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming?
