The code looks good (and failure is as expected :) -- but is keeping it in a separate job the best approach? Reason for asking: The way it is right now it's not really represented \"at a glance\" (in the README.md's CI status buttons). Given it's really a Linux test, would it be (more) sensible to add it within the existing Linux test (to see a failure suitably highlighted?). Also it's not really telling us too much about Windows or MacOS memory leaks, does it? It's unlikely there should be (different) leaks on those platforms but we don't really know without running an \"asan-equivalent\" there, right?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1708843032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-06T17:55:10Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

So if we did that in front of Dilithium, it would no longer be Dilithium, it would be Dilithium-with-an-extra-hash, and therefore not interoperable with Dilithium, necessitating different algorithm identifiers and so on, as Michael points out.\r\n\r\nDilithium itself hashes the message, and does so with some extra inputs (including the public key as input to the hash, if memory serves), which adds certain types of robustness properties.  There has been some discussion on the LAMPS mailing list about pre-hashing and whether it's a good idea or not; I believe people with HSMs like pre-hashing because otherwise you have to feed the full message into the HSM for Dilithium.  I don't know what the resolution on that issue was -- I think there are some research questions to be had here, and @praveksharma was planning to take a look at it, but hasn't had a chance to do so yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1709089184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-06T20:42:59Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
