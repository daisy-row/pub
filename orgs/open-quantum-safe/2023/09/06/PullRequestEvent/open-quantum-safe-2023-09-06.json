windows artifact build process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.68.0</h1>\n<h2>Added</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>system</code> ABI is now supported as an option for the <code>--override-abi</code> flag.</li>\n<li>The <code>allowlist_item</code> method and the <code>--allowlist-item</code> flag have been\nincluded to filter items regardless or their kind.</li>\n<li>Include installers as release artifacts on Github.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Clone</code> implementation for <code>_BindgenUnionField</code> has been changed to pass\nthe <code>incorrect_clone_impl_on_copy_type</code> Clippy lint.</li>\n<li>The <code>c_unwind</code> ABI can be used without a feature gate for any Rust target version\nequal to or greater than 1.71.\nThis comes as a result of the ABI being stabilised (in Rust 1.71).</li>\n<li>Formatting changes when using prettyplease as a formatter due to a new\nprettyplease version.</li>\n<li>Avoid generating invalid <code>CStr</code> constants when using the <code>--generate-cstr</code>\noption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>extra_assert</code> and <code>extra_assert_eq</code> macros are no longer exported.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bindgen no longer panics when parsing an objective-C header that includes a\nRust keyword that cannot be a raw identifier, such as: <code>self</code>, <code>crate</code>,\n<code>super</code> or <code>Self</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.67.0</h1>\n<p>This version was skipped due to some problems on the release workflow.</p>\n<h1>0.66.1</h1>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Revert source order sorting (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/2543\">#2543</a>) due to correctness regressions <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/2558\">#2558</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>0.66.0</h1>\n<h2>Added</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added the <code>--generate-cstr</code> CLI flag to generate string constants as <code>&amp;CStr</code>\ninstead of <code>&amp;[u8]</code>. (Requires Rust 1.59 or higher.)</li>\n<li>Added the <code>--generate-shell-completions</code> CLI flag to generate completions for\ndifferent shells.</li>\n<li>The <code>--wrap-static-fns</code> option can now wrap <code>va_list</code> functions as variadic functions\nwith the experimental <code>ParseCallbacks::wrap_as_variadic_fn</code> method.</li>\n<li>Add target mappings for riscv32imc and riscv32imac.</li>\n<li>Add the <code>ParseCallbacks::field_visibility</code> method to modify field visibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
