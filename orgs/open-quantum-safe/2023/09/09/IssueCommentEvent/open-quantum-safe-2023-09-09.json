But still, **this does not solve the issue and I'm still getting error:10800094:PKCS7 routines::signing not supported for this key type error**.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following

One data pool is used\r\n    for all consumers in a process, so that consumption under program flow can\r\n    act as additional stirring. The subsystem is re-seeded from the kernel\r\n    random number subsystem on a regular basis\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\nIt seems like the intent of apple here is to provide a simple to use cryptographically-secure random  number generator that they will update as technology progresses.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1712552132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-09-09T16:44:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
