If it's not NULL, we assume it's already initialized, thus we return error. \r\nTo reach line 39, `sk->secret_key_data` must be NULL. Which make the `memcpy` is SEGFAULT. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of creating `static once = 1` as static variable to make sure the initialization happen only once. \r\nBut this lead to:\r\n\r\n- We will have 2 ways to allocate memory for `sk->secret_key_data`, either in `deserialize`, and in key generation.\r\n- If I use `static` variable, I don't know in the case we multithread/fork process, would it become complicate to make sure the `sk->secret_key_data` happen only once with `static` variable.
