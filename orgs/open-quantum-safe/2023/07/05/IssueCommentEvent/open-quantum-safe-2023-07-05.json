Here is the error I got from clang:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nclang: error: invalid argument '-compatibility_version 1.0.0' only allowed with '-dynamiclib'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I found out that the [`SOVERSION` and `VERSION`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/SOVERSION.html) properties should not be used when building a shared library. This doesn't seem to lead to an error on Linux, but on macOS, it happens to set the following two flags:\r\n  * `-compatibility_version` (given by `SOVERSION`)\r\n  * `-current_version` (given by `VERSION`)\r\n\r\nHowever, CMake uses the `-bundle` flag when linking, instead of the `-dynamiclib` flag.\r\n\r\nI found a fix by reading the documentation:\r\n\r\n> For shared libraries, the MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\r\n> properties can be used to override the compatibility version and current\r\n> version respectively.\r\n\r\nSetting these two flags to `OFF` removes `-compatibility_version` and `-current_version`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should simply remove `SOVERSION` and `VERSION`, as they're only meant to be used for shared libraries?\r\n\r\n## Second issue\r\n\r\nOpenSSL has an API to load dynamic objects and libraries called `DSO`. When loading a provider, a call to `dlfcn_name_converter` is made to compute the name of the file:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/79fa5873a9c2f2df392bc4b39146d8db37640118/crypto/dso/dso_dlfcn.c#L253-L280\r\n\r\nReader may notice that OpenSSL appends the macro `DSO_EXTENSION` to the end of the provider's name.\r\n`DSO_EXTENSION` is platform-specific: its value is `.so` on Unix, and `.dylib` on macOS.\r\nBecause we're building a `MODULE` library here instead of a `SHARED` library, the output file's extension is `.so` instead of `.dylib`. Thus, OpenSSL fails to find the `oqs-provider` to load.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, I used the [`SUFFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/SUFFIX.html) property of CMake targets to explicitely specify the extension when building for a XNU-based platform (macOS, iOS, watchOS, etc.).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

This results in some code replication. A smarter way to do it would be to have regular key generation just call deterministic key generation with a random seed, but this would mean altering how regular key generation works so I stayed away from that (for now). It should be an easy change everywhere else if that's eventually modified.\r\n\r\nAs well, I've added a test_derive_keypair script, which just derives a keypair twice from the same, random seed and compares them to check that the same secret and public key is derived each time.\r\n\r\nThere should be some sort of check to make sure that everything other than kyber is disabled, since this only adds deterministic key derivation for kyber, but I wasn't sure about the best way to add that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1621936741","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1491#issuecomment-1621936741","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491","id":1621936741,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5grMpl","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T14:56:55Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T14:56:55Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Before merging this, we'd also need some documentation updates explaining this new functionality (in the README and may be examples) as well as adding it to the algorithm data sheets.\r\n\r\nAnd as pointed out in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1491#issuecomment-1582499077, also need to either make changes upstream or add them to our patch mechanism so they don't get wiped out next time we do a copy-from-upstream.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1621936741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-05T14:56:56Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
