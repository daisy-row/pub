More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**oqs-provider** is a standalone [OpenSSL 3](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)-based quantum-safe and hybrid key exchange for TLS 1.3, as well as quantum-safe and hybrid X.509 certificate generation, CMS and `dgst` operations.\r\n\r\nWhen deployed, the `oqs-provider` binary (shared library) thus adds support for quantum-safe cryptographic operations to any standard OpenSSL(v3) installation.\r\n\r\nIn general, the oqs-provider `main` branch is meant to be useable in conjunction with the `main` branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and the `master` branch of [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).\r\n\r\nFurther details on building, testing and use can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.5.1-rc1 of oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n### Security considerations\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### What's New\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.5.0 release of oqs-provider and is fully tested to be used in conjunction with the main branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs). This release is guaranteed to be in sync with v0.8.0 of `liboqs`.\r\n\r\n### Additional new feature highlights\r\n\r\n- Support for Windows platform\r\n- Added `brew` support for MacOS\r\n- Documentation restructured supporting different platforms\r\n- Enable statically linkable oqsprovider\r\n\r\n#### What's Changed (full commit list)\r\n\r\n* trigger oqs-demos build when pushing to main by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/182\r\n* Enable building on platforms without _Atomic support by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/183\r\n* Standalone ctest by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/184\r\n* Convert oqs-kem-info.md code points to hex by @WillChilds-Klein in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/188\r\n* Documentation update by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/187\r\n* Add full Windows support by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/192\r\n* Improve installation by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/196\r\n* document specs [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/190\r\n* Add .DS_Store (macOS), .vscode (visual studio code), and .idea (Jetbr… by @planetf1 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/200\r\n* first test for macos CI by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/198\r\n* Add brew to preinstall test matrix by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/205\r\n* General documentation overhaul by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/204\r\n* change TLS demo to use QSC alg [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/208\r\n* Build a module instead of a shared library. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/207\r\n* explain groups in USAGE [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/214\r\n* ensure OpenSSL3 is linked to liboqs during script build by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/212\r\n* Remove trailing whitespaces in generated code. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/215\r\n* Fix a minor bug in the `runtests.sh`. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/216\r\n* Specify version `3.1` while installing OpenSSL using brew. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/217\r\n* Allow the user to build oqs-provider as a static library. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201\r\n* Add a line to `RELEASE.md` to highlight the support for static libraries by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/220\r\n* Enhance github bug report template by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/219\r\n* Use OpenSSL 3 if available to build liboqs on CircleCI/macOS. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/222\r\n* Fix a bug in the CMake script. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/221\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @WillChilds-Klein made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/188\r\n* @planetf1 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/200\r\n* @thb-sb made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/207\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/compare/0.5.0...0.5.1","mentions_count":4,"mentions":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3589880?v=4","login":"WillChilds-Klein","profile_name":"Will Childs-Klein","profile_url":"https://github.com/WillChilds-Klein","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7292002?v=4","login":"planetf1","profile_name":"Nigel Jones","profile_url":"https://github.com/planetf1","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","login":"baentsch","profile_name":"Michael Baentsch","profile_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108470890?v=4","login":"thb-sb","profile_name":null,"profile_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb","avatar_user_actor":true}],"short_description_html":"<h1>oqs-provider 0.5.1-rc1</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
