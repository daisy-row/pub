Problem is that in various places (e.g., `oqsprov.c`) they clash with our code-generating logic (see e.g. [this CI run](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/actions/runs/5482870210/jobs/9988632577?pr=201): If anything gets changed between \"OQS_TEMPLATE_FRAGMENT...START\" and \"...END\" brackets, the corresponding changes (also) must be present in the corresponding generator code in `oqs-template` (to survive a next code generation round, i.e., when integrating a new iteration of `liboqs`). Please see the first step in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/wiki/Release-process. Thus, can I ask you to also update the template files with these end-of-line changes (eliminating spaces?), run `python3 oqs-template/generate.py` and re-build/test? An update is anyway necessary to address the merge conflict introduced by your previous contribution... :) Thanks in advance.","commit_id":"f9fcbe366a0eb7f0990fa1f5a4cfb7e982aa0961","submitted_at":"2023-07-07T05:28:08Z","state":"changes_requested","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201#pullrequestreview-1517908814","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/201","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201#pullrequestreview-1517908814"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/201"}}},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/201","id":1413587212,"node_id":"PR_kwDOE_A9l85UQaEM","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/201","number":201,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Allow the user to build oqs-provider as a static library.","user":{"login":"thb-sb","id":108470890,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnciag","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108470890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb","html_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"This commit removes the `SHARED` argument of the `add_library`.
