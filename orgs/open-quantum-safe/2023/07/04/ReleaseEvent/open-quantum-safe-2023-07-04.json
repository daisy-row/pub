More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.\r\n\r\n**open-quantum-safe/boringssl** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) BoringSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography in TLS 1.3.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is the 2023-06 snapshot release of OQS-BoringSSL, released on June 26, 2023.
