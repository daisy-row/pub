Here is the error I got from clang:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nclang: error: invalid argument '-compatibility_version 1.0.0' only allowed with '-dynamiclib'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I found out that the [`SOVERSION` and `VERSION`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/SOVERSION.html) properties should not be used when building a shared library. This doesn't seem to lead to an error on Linux, but on macOS, it happens to set the following two flags:\r\n  * `-compatibility_version` (given by `SOVERSION`)\r\n  * `-current_version` (given by `VERSION`)\r\n\r\nHowever, CMake uses the `-bundle` flag when linking, instead of the `-dynamiclib` flag.\r\n\r\nI found a fix by reading the documentation:\r\n\r\n> For shared libraries, the MACHO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION and MACHO_CURRENT_VERSION\r\n> properties can be used to override the compatibility version and current\r\n> version respectively.\r\n\r\nSetting these two flags to `OFF` removes `-compatibility_version` and `-current_version`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should simply remove `SOVERSION` and `VERSION`, as they're only meant to be used for shared libraries?\r\n\r\n## Second issue\r\n\r\nOpenSSL has an API to load dynamic objects and libraries called `DSO`. When loading a provider, a call to `dlfcn_name_converter` is made to compute the name of the file:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/79fa5873a9c2f2df392bc4b39146d8db37640118/crypto/dso/dso_dlfcn.c#L253-L280\r\n\r\nReader may notice that OpenSSL appends the macro `DSO_EXTENSION` to the end of the provider's name.\r\n`DSO_EXTENSION` is platform-specific: its value is `.so` on Unix, and `.dylib` on macOS.\r\nBecause we're building a `MODULE` library here instead of a `SHARED` library, the output file's extension is `.so` instead of `.dylib`. Thus, OpenSSL fails to find the `oqs-provider` to load.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, I used the [`SUFFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/SUFFIX.html) property of CMake targets to explicitely specify the extension when building for a XNU-based platform (macOS, iOS, watchOS, etc.).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
