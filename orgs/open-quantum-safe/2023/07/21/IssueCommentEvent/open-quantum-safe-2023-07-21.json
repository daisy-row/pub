This PR brings `Dockerfile-m1` in sync with `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-arm64` and updates the CircleCI config to build and push an `oqs-perf:latest-m1` image. The bulk of the changes involve updating the M1 Dockerfile to pull `open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider` instead of `open-quantum-safe/openssl`.\r\n\r\nTwo small items of note:\r\n- I preemptively fixed the permissions issue fixed by #104 in the M1 Dockerfile. When that PR is merged, it will bring the three files in sync.\r\n- I deleted the undefined `OPENSSL_BUILD_DEFINES` variable from OpenSSL build instructions in the ARM and x86 Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to resolving #103: once this PR and #104 are merged, I'll run some tests on the M1 machine and determine whether or not it's worth keeping the extra Dockerfile around. I suspect not, as it really is essentially the same as the ARM Dockerfile, but we'll see.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/comments/1645601754","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pull/105#issuecomment-1645601754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/105","id":1645601754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOETYnOM5iFePa","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-21T13:35:59Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T13:35:59Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> LGTM.

All XMSS parameters are separated by namespace.\r\n2. After discussion with Andreas Huelsing, he recommends using the `fast` approach. This approach improved the performance of `signing` at the cost of larger `sk`. \r\n3. The `_fast` parameters is **incompatible** with the general version. At first, I couldn't believe it, I went back and generate original KATs file from [original Github repo](https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference-original-kat/pull/1/files). And I confirm that the `_fast` and general version, given the same message and same randomness, it will generate different signatures. Given the signature of `_fast`, the general version cannot verify using `_fast` parameter public key. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue in xmss-reference: https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference/issues/17\r\n\r\n4.
