This PR brings `Dockerfile-m1` in sync with `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-arm64` and updates the CircleCI config to build and push an `oqs-perf:latest-m1` image. The bulk of the changes involve updating the M1 Dockerfile to pull `open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider` instead of `open-quantum-safe/openssl`.\r\n\r\nTwo small items of note:\r\n- I preemptively fixed the permissions issue fixed by #104 in the M1 Dockerfile. When that PR is merged, it will bring the three files in sync.\r\n- I deleted the undefined `OPENSSL_BUILD_DEFINES` variable from OpenSSL build instructions in the ARM and x86 Dockerfiles.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to resolving #103: once this PR and #104 are merged, I'll run some tests on the M1 machine and determine whether or not it's worth keeping the extra Dockerfile around. I suspect not, as it really is essentially the same as the ARM Dockerfile, but we'll see.","created_at":"2023-07-20T14:36:26Z","updated_at":"2023-07-21T10:05:51Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9522293a89313a553db37bd13e02dfc4359cd5ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/statuses/679ca902c4845cb2fa83e61092ea5bfbd7e74a7a","head":{"label":"open-quantum-safe:sw-m1-update","ref":"sw-m1-update","sha":"679ca902c4845cb2fa83e61092ea5bfbd7e74a7a","user":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":288761656,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODg3NjE2NTY=","name":"profiling","full_name":"open-quantum-safe/profiling","private":false,"owner":{"login":"open-quantum-safe","id":20689385,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIwNjg5Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/open-quantum-safe/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling","description":"Network-level
