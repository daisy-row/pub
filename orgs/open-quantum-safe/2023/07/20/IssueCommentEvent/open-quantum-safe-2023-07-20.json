All XMSS parameters are separated by namespace.\r\n2. After discussion with Andreas Huelsing, he recommends using the `fast` approach. This approach improved the performance of `signing` at the cost of larger `sk`. \r\n3. The `_fast` parameters is **incompatible** with the general version. At first, I couldn't believe it, I went back and generate original KATs file from [original Github repo](https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference-original-kat/pull/1/files). And I confirm that the `_fast` and general version, given the same message and same randomness, it will generate different signatures. Given the signature of `_fast`, the general version cannot verify using `_fast` parameter public key. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue in xmss-reference: https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference/issues/17\r\n\r\n4.
