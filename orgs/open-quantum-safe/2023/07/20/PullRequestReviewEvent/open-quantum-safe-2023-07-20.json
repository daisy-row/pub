[#207] introduced a check for setting the right suffix to the library, depending on the target OS:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/823f3178dd50eeb5febf29eb82680400c4d9e887/oqsprov/CMakeLists.txt#L61-L7://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/823f3178dd50eeb5febf29eb82680400c4d9e887/oqsprov/CMakeLists.txt#L61-L79\r\n\r\nHowever, mixed with PR [#201] and the `OQS_PROVIDER_BUILD_STATIC` option, the library may be suffixed with the wrong extension: we may end up with a static library named `oqsprovider.dylib`, even if it's an archive:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cmake -GNinja \\\r\n    -DOQS_PROVIDER_BUILD_STATIC=ON \\\r\n    -B build\r\n$ cmake --build build\r\n$ file build/lib/oqsprovider.dylib\r\nbuild/lib/oqsprovider.dylib: current ar archive random library\r\n$ # ^ should be named `oqsprovider.a`!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe check mentioned above is only relevant when oqsprovider is built as a module.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this bug and introduces a check in the CircleCI jobs to verify that `oqsprovider.a` is actually produced.\r\n\r\n[#201](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/201)\r\n[#207](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/207)\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-19T11:51:12Z","updated_at":"2023-07-20T06:48:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c520fab6a7fbe4f30367cc736bc3ea22c5b8247a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/statuses/f0ede8cb94d31896ff8904d6a99aa2ee2c333db0","head":{"label":"thb-sb:bug_cmake","ref":"bug_cmake","sha":"f0ede8cb94d31896ff8904d6a99aa2ee2c333db0","user":{"login":"thb-sb","id":108470890,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnciag","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108470890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb","html_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":660254715,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ1qv-w","name":"oqs-provider","full_name":"thb-sb/oqs-provider","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thb-sb","id":108470890,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnciag","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108470890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb","html_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thb-sb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb/oqs-provider","description":"OpenSSL
