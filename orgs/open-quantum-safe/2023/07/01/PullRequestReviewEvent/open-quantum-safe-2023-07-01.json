But I'd argue the above/the latest commits don't seem an ideal solution: That way the tests for the new configuration only check whether it can build but not whether `oqsprovider` can run in this config. \r\n\r\nA more complete solution (not requiring any changes to any CI logic, i.e., performing functional testing) seems to be possible by using the new config variable as a #define in the test cases to call `OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin` and in the `tests/CMakeLists.txt` to suitably link the (then static) lib in to deliver the required init symbol.
