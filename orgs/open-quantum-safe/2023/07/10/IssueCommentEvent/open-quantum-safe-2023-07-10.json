If you'd like to try it, it still is accessible under the \":0.7.2\" tag.\r\n> \r\n> Going forward, would you possibly consider checking out https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3/general (and the generating code at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/tree/main/openssl3) to state improvements missing there (and maybe add them via PR there)?\r\n\r\nThanks!

A similar trigger exists from oqs-openssl111 to oqs-demos. This leads to an inefficient repeated execution of oqs-demos CCI if `liboqs` changes trigger downstream CCI to both `oqs-openssl111` and `oqs-provider`. Can this be improved/are both necessary?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1629728155","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1499#issuecomment-1629728155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1499","id":1629728155,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5hI62b","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T21:03:09Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T21:03:09Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I have a PR open for the liboqs-python side here: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/pull/65\r\n\r\nQuick note: it seems that \"success\" in the liboqs pipeline doesn't mean that the liboqs-python pipeline completed with no errors but rather that it was started successfully.
