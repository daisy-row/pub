Ensure the system requirements listed [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#System-requirements) are met.\n+\n+1. To obtain the source code, follow the instructions given [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#Install) in the \"Install depot_tools\" section and in the \"Get the code\" section up to (and not including) the \"Install additional build dependencies\" sub-section. Note: Do *not* set `--no-history` to save time as you need git history in the next step.\n+\n+2. Navigate to the root directory of the source code, which we will refer to hereafter as `<CHROMIMUM_ROOT>`, and run `git checkout 100.0.4856.2`, which is the latest tag for which we have verified the build instructions. Then, to ensure that all of chromium's third party dependencies are compatible with this tag, run `gclient sync`.\n+\n+*Note*: Depending on the OS version installed, you may have to install python2, e.g., using `sudo apt install -y python2`, and ensure it's set as the system default, e.g., via `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python`.\n+\n+3. Navigate to `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src`, and switch the BoringSSL source code to the OQS-BoringSSL fork by running the following commands:\n+\n+- `git remote add oqs-bssl https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl`\n+- `git fetch oqs-bssl`\n+- `git checkout -b oqs-bssl-master oqs-bssl/master`\n+\n+4. In a directory of your choosing, clone and build liboqs as follows:\n+\n+- `git clone --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git`\n+- `cd liboqs && mkdir build && cd build`\n+- `cmake .. -G\"Ninja\" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src/oqs -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF`\n+- `ninja && ninja install`\n+\n+Note: You might have to install `ninja` if not already done, e.g., by running `sudo apt-get install ninja`. You also might want to run `SKIP_TESTS=doxygen,style ninja run_tests` to validate liboqs operating OK on your machine. For this you need to install `pytest` if not already present on your machine, e.g., by running `sudo apt-get install python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist` first.\n+\n+Note: If you want to execute the resulting binaries on another machine, be sure to also pass [-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=ON](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#oqs_dist_build) to the `cmake` command above to obtain code running on all machines of the same architecture type.\n+\n+5. After successfully installing liboqs as per the above, navigate to `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>` and apply the `oqs-changes.patch` file provided here by running `git apply <PATH_TO_PATCH_FILE>`. Then, navigate to `third_party/boringssl`, and run `python src/util/generate_build_files.py gn`.\n+\n+Note: For this to succeed, you might have to install go if not already present on your machine, e.g., by running `sudo apt install golang-go`. If _any_ error occurs in this step, Chromium will build fine, just without support for quantum-safe crypto, i.e., only the final testing steps below will fail.\n+\n+6. Finally, navigate back to <CHROMIUM_ROOT> and follow the instructions [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#Install-additional-build-dependencies) from the \"Install additional build dependencies\" section onwards to build Chromium. \n+\n+Note: If you have already built another chromium source tree (version), you may have to execute `gclient sync --force` to ensure all dependencies are properly updated.\n+\n+Note: It is *strongly* advisable to set certain build options to obtain a size-and-performance optimized chromium variant, also saving on build time. Do this by executing `gn args out/Default` and adding the following variables to the configuration file opened in your editor:\n+```\n+# Set build arguments here. See `gn help buildargs`.\n+is_debug = false\n+symbol_level = 0\n+enable_nacl = false\n+blink_symbol_level=0\n+```\n+\n+\n+If the build completes successfully, i.e., the executable `chrome` has been created, one can verify that Chromium can perform a TLS 1.3 handshake using a post-quantum key exchange by executing these steps:\n+\n+0. Navigate to `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>`, and start Chromium by executing `./out/Default/chrome`\n+1. Navigate again to the `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src` folder, and build OQS-BoringSSL as a standalone project by running `mkdir build && cd build && cmake -GNinja ..`.\n+2. Then, in the `build` directory, run `./tool/bssl server -accept 4433 -www -loop -curves <KEX>`, where `<KEX>` can be any key-exchange algorithm named [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl#supported-algorithms) that is supported by default by Chromium. The [kDefaultGroups array](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/wiki/Implementation-Notes) lists all such algorithms\\*.\n+3. Load `https://localhost:4433` in Chromium.\n+\n+An alternative test consists of using the newly built Chromium to access the OQS test server at [https://test.openquantumsafe.org](https://test.openquantumsafe.org) and clicking on any of the algorithm combinations [supported by Chromium](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/blob/master/ssl/t1_lib.cc#L375), e.g., `p256_kyber512`).","path":"chromium/README-Linux.md","commit_id":"9dec01b8ea68d0f0fea6e73ef52b837905895a50","original_commit_id":"9dec01b8ea68d0f0fea6e73ef52b837905895a50","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"> Do you want me to remove README-Linux.md ?

Ensure the system requirements listed [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#System-requirements) are met.\n+\n+1. To obtain the source code, follow the instructions given [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#Install) in the \"Install depot_tools\" section and in the \"Get the code\" section up to (and not including) the \"Install additional build dependencies\" sub-section. Note: Do *not* set `--no-history` to save time as you need git history in the next step.\n+\n+2. Navigate to the root directory of the source code, which we will refer to hereafter as `<CHROMIMUM_ROOT>`, and run `git checkout 100.0.4856.2`, which is the latest tag for which we have verified the build instructions. Then, to ensure that all of chromium's third party dependencies are compatible with this tag, run `gclient sync`.\n+\n+*Note*: Depending on the OS version installed, you may have to install python2, e.g., using `sudo apt install -y python2`, and ensure it's set as the system default, e.g., via `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python`.\n+\n+3. Navigate to `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src`, and switch the BoringSSL source code to the OQS-BoringSSL fork by running the following commands:\n+\n+- `git remote add oqs-bssl https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl`\n+- `git fetch oqs-bssl`\n+- `git checkout -b oqs-bssl-master oqs-bssl/master`\n+\n+4. In a directory of your choosing, clone and build liboqs as follows:\n+\n+- `git clone --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git`\n+- `cd liboqs && mkdir build && cd build`\n+- `cmake .. -G\"Ninja\" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src/oqs -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF`\n+- `ninja && ninja install`\n+\n+Note: You might have to install `ninja` if not already done, e.g., by running `sudo apt-get install ninja`. You also might want to run `SKIP_TESTS=doxygen,style ninja run_tests` to validate liboqs operating OK on your machine. For this you need to install `pytest` if not already present on your machine, e.g., by running `sudo apt-get install python3-pytest python3-pytest-xdist` first.\n+\n+Note: If you want to execute the resulting binaries on another machine, be sure to also pass [-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=ON](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#oqs_dist_build) to the `cmake` command above to obtain code running on all machines of the same architecture type.\n+\n+5. After successfully installing liboqs as per the above, navigate to `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>` and apply the `oqs-changes.patch` file provided here by running `git apply <PATH_TO_PATCH_FILE>`. Then, navigate to `third_party/boringssl`, and run `python src/util/generate_build_files.py gn`.\n+\n+Note: For this to succeed, you might have to install go if not already present on your machine, e.g., by running `sudo apt install golang-go`. If _any_ error occurs in this step, Chromium will build fine, just without support for quantum-safe crypto, i.e., only the final testing steps below will fail.\n+\n+6. Finally, navigate back to <CHROMIUM_ROOT> and follow the instructions [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/linux/build_instructions.md#Install-additional-build-dependencies) from the \"Install additional build dependencies\" section onwards to build Chromium. \n+\n+Note: If you have already built another chromium source tree (version), you may have to execute `gclient sync --force` to ensure all dependencies are properly updated.\n+\n+Note: It is *strongly* advisable to set certain build options to obtain a size-and-performance optimized chromium variant, also saving on build time. Do this by executing `gn args out/Default` and adding the following variables to the configuration file opened in your editor:\n+```\n+# Set build arguments here. See `gn help buildargs`.\n+is_debug = false\n+symbol_level = 0\n+enable_nacl = false\n+blink_symbol_level=0\n+```\n+\n+\n+If the build completes successfully, i.e., the executable `chrome` has been created, one can verify that Chromium can perform a TLS 1.3 handshake using a post-quantum key exchange by executing these steps:\n+\n+0. Navigate to `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>`, and start Chromium by executing `./out/Default/chrome`\n+1. Navigate again to the `<CHROMIUM_ROOT>/third_party/boringssl/src` folder, and build OQS-BoringSSL as a standalone project by running `mkdir build && cd build && cmake -GNinja ..`.\n+2. Then, in the `build` directory, run `./tool/bssl server -accept 4433 -www -loop -curves <KEX>`, where `<KEX>` can be any key-exchange algorithm named [here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl#supported-algorithms) that is supported by default by Chromium. The [kDefaultGroups array](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/wiki/Implementation-Notes) lists all such algorithms\\*.\n+3. Load `https://localhost:4433` in Chromium.\n+\n+An alternative test consists of using the newly built Chromium to access the OQS test server at [https://test.openquantumsafe.org](https://test.openquantumsafe.org) and clicking on any of the algorithm combinations [supported by Chromium](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl/blob/master/ssl/t1_lib.cc#L375), e.g., `p256_kyber512`).","path":"chromium/README-Linux.md","commit_id":"e6ea7bf0b31294360801623fae02468048e9f60f","original_commit_id":"9dec01b8ea68d0f0fea6e73ef52b837905895a50","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"> I think we can merge README-Linux and README-Windows into a single file in the future\r\n\r\nThat would probably be best.\r\n\r\n> I also modified the git command so it will fetch a specific boringssl commit\r\n\r\nThis seems very risky to me: Any future updates to oqs-boringssl will then not be picked up any more.
