For some algorithms, integration is done manually, for some automated (`copy_from_upstream`, `copy_from_xkcp`). While care has been taken to document the resultant \"zoo of licenses\", more locations than one exist for this, e.g., \"spdx-identifiers\" in all source code files, a \"summary spdx-identifier\" in the  [algorithm documentation sheets](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/docs/algorithms), separate \"LICENSE\" files (originating with but possibly [not in line with the upstream code bases](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1512#discussion_r1271456474)) and a central [LICENSE](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) file  valid only for the `liboqs` API, pointing to the sub-folder LICENSE files.\r\n\r\nFor research purposes, where publication (of code and results) is norm and goal, it arguably is sufficient that code _has_ a license -- which `liboqs` already provides. For integration into commercial products (including OS distributions) this arguably is insufficient (see e.g., #1437).\r\n\r\nIf the goal is to be able to create binaries suitable for inclusion into commercial software distros (?), e.g., RedHat, all code in `liboqs` arguably needs to have unambiguous license statements. Given the large corpus of \"external\" code (`liboqs` already counts 225 \"LICENSE\" files -- even before the inclusion of LMS/XMSS) this needs to be fully automated, such as to allow creation of binaries that can be used in commercial distributions (e.g., MIT, Apache2) and those that can be used in truly open, e.g., research settings (e.g., CC0, GPL).\r\n\r\nThis issue is to propose work to review and automate all license handling within `liboqs` -- with the ultimate goal to allow `liboqs` (and its subprojects and users) [to select at build time only those algorithms/code bases using specific licenses](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1437#issuecomment-1549014050), e.g., \"commercialization friendly\" (e.g., MIT, Apache) or \"fully open source\" (e.g., GPL) or \"research friendly\" (arguably any).\r\n\r\nThoughts about the need (and timeline and willingness to support this work) for this particularly welcome from anyone possibly having a commercial use case in mind, e.g., @vsoftco @christianpaquin @bhess @crockeea @beldmit @thb-sb  (already thumbs up or down would be helpful to gauge interest in this boring \"legalese\" issue :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-24T06:29:35Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
