There are two main ways\n+for this:\n+\n+### Explicit command line option\n+\n+#### -provider\n+\n+Most `openssl` commands permit passing the option `-provider`: The name after\n+this command is that of the provider to be activated.\n+\n+As an example: `openssl list -signature-algorithms -provider oqsprovider`\n+outputs all quantum safe signature algorithms made available for `openssl` use.\n+\n+#### -provider-path\n+\n+All `openssl` commands accepting `-provider` also permit passing `-provider-path`\n+as a possibility to reference the location in the local filesystem where the\n+provider binary is located. This is of particular use if the provider did not\n+(yet) get installed in the system location, which typically is in `lib/ossl-modules`\n+in the main `openssl` installation tree.\n+\n+### Configuration file\n+\n+As an alternative to passing command line parameters, providers can be activated\n+for general use by adding instructions to the `openssl.cnf` file. In the case of\n+`oqs-provider` add these lines to achieve this:\n+\n+```\n+[provider_sect]\n+default = default_sect\n+oqsprovider = oqsprovider_sect\n+[oqsprovider_sect]\n+activate = 1\n+```\n+\n+#### module option\n+\n+Next to the \"activate\" keyword, `openssl` also recognizes the \"module\" keyword\n+which mirrors the functionality of `-provider-path` documented above: This way,\n+a non-standard location for the `oqsprovider` shared library (.SO/.DYLIB/.DLL)\n+can be registered for testing.\n+\n+If this configuration variable is not set, the global environment variable\n+\"OPENSSL_MODULES\" must point to a directory where the `oqsprovider` binary\n+is to be found. \n+\n+If the `oqsprovider` binary cannot be found, it simply (and silently) will\n+not be available for use.\n+\n+#### System wide installation\n+\n+The system-wide `openssl.cnf` file is typically located at (operating system dependent):\n+- /etc/ssl/ (UNIX/Linux)\n+- /opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3/ (OSX Homebrew)","path":"USAGE.md","commit_id":"eeff9a7f0e5a0ab6a5c37f327cca7e02ee742f07","original_commit_id":"eeff9a7f0e5a0ab6a5c37f327cca7e02ee742f07","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"/opt/homebrew is the path for brew on macOS on Apple Silicon.
