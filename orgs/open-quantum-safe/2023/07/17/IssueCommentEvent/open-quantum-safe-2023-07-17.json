All XMSS parameters are separated by namespace.\r\n2. After discussion with Andreas Huelsing, he recommends using the `fast` approach. This approach improved the performance of `signing` at the cost of larger `sk`. \r\n3. The `_fast` parameters is **incompatible** with the general version. At first, I couldn't believe it, I went back and generate original KATs file from [original Github repo](https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference-original-kat/pull/1/files). And I confirm that the `_fast` and general version, given the same message and same randomness, it will generate different signatures. Given the signature of `_fast`, the general version cannot verify using `_fast` parameter public key. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue in xmss-reference: https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference/issues/17\r\n\r\n4. All parameters are tested with pre-generated KAT files and SHA256 hashes of the KAT. \r\n\r\nAll the parameters added to XMSS. \r\n\r\n```\r\n| Algorithms                    | oid  | sk     | pk  | sig  | n  |\r\n|-------------------------------|------|--------|-----|------|----|\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_10_256              | 0x01 |  1373 |  64 |  2500 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_16_256              | 0x02 |  2093 |  64 |  2692 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_20_256              | 0x03 |  2573 |  64 |  2820 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_10_256             | 0x07 |  1373 |  64 |  2500 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_16_256             | 0x08 |  2093 |  64 |  2692 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_20_256             | 0x09 |  2573 |  64 |  2820 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_10_512              | 0x04 |  2653 | 128 |  9092 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_16_512              | 0x05 |  4045 | 128 |  9476 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_20_512              | 0x06 |  4973 | 128 |  9732 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_10_512             | 0x0a |  2653 | 128 |  9092 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_16_512             | 0x0b |  4045 | 128 |  9476 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_20_512             | 0x0c |  4973 | 128 |  9732 | 64 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256          | 0x01 |  5998 |  64 |  4963 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_20/4_256          | 0x02 | 10938 |  64 |  9251 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_40/2_256          | 0x03 |  9600 |  64 |  5605 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_40/4_256          | 0x04 | 15252 |  64 |  9893 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_40/8_256          | 0x05 | 24516 |  64 | 18469 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_60/3_256          | 0x06 | 16629 |  64 |  8392 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_60/6_256          | 0x07 | 24507 |  64 | 14824 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_60/12_256         | 0x08 | 38095 |  64 | 27688 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_20/2_256         | 0x11 |  5998 |  64 |  4963 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_20/4_256         | 0x12 | 10938 |  64 |  9251 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_40/2_256         | 0x13 |  9600 |  64 |  5605 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_40/4_256         | 0x14 | 15252 |  64 |  9893 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_40/8_256         | 0x15 | 24516 |  64 | 18469 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_60/3_256         | 0x16 | 16629 |  64 |  8392 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_60/6_256         | 0x17 | 24507 |  64 | 14824 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_60/12_256        | 0x18 | 38095 |  64 | 27688 | 32 |\r\n```\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?

All XMSS parameters are separated by namespace.\r\n2. After discussion with Andreas Huelsing, he recommends using the `fast` approach. This approach improved the performance of `signing` at the cost of larger `sk`. \r\n3. The `_fast` parameters is **incompatible** with the general version. At first, I couldn't believe it, I went back and generate original KATs file from [original Github repo](https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference-original-kat/pull/1/files). And I confirm that the `_fast` and general version, given the same message and same randomness, it will generate different signatures. Given the signature of `_fast`, the general version cannot verify using `_fast` parameter public key. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue in xmss-reference: https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference/issues/17\r\n\r\n4.

All XMSS parameters are separated by namespace.\r\n2. After discussion with Andreas Huelsing, he recommends using the `fast` approach. This approach improved the performance of `signing` at the cost of larger `sk`. \r\n3. The `_fast` parameters is **incompatible** with the general version. At first, I couldn't believe it, I went back and generate original KATs file from [original Github repo](https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference-original-kat/pull/1/files). And I confirm that the `_fast` and general version, given the same message and same randomness, it will generate different signatures. Given the signature of `_fast`, the general version cannot verify using `_fast` parameter public key. \r\n\r\nSimilar issue in xmss-reference: https://github.com/XMSS/xmss-reference/issues/17\r\n\r\n4. All parameters are tested with pre-generated KAT files and SHA256 hashes of the KAT. \r\n\r\nAll the parameters added to XMSS. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/blob/master/external/xmss_liboqs_params.md\r\n\r\n\r\n| Algorithms                    | oid  | sk     | pk  | sig  | n  |\r\n|-------------------------------|------|--------|-----|------|----|\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_10_256              | 0x01 |  1373 |  64 |  2500 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_16_256              | 0x02 |  2093 |  64 |  2692 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_20_256              | 0x03 |  2573 |  64 |  2820 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_10_256             | 0x07 |  1373 |  64 |  2500 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_16_256             | 0x08 |  2093 |  64 |  2692 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_20_256             | 0x09 |  2573 |  64 |  2820 | 32 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_10_512              | 0x04 |  2653 | 128 |  9092 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_16_512              | 0x05 |  4045 | 128 |  9476 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHA2_20_512              | 0x06 |  4973 | 128 |  9732 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_10_512             | 0x0a |  2653 | 128 |  9092 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_16_512             | 0x0b |  4045 | 128 |  9476 | 64 |\r\n| XMSS-SHAKE_20_512             | 0x0c |  4973 | 128 |  9732 | 64 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_20/2_256          | 0x01 |  5998 |  64 |  4963 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_20/4_256          | 0x02 | 10938 |  64 |  9251 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_40/2_256          | 0x03 |  9600 |  64 |  5605 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_40/4_256          | 0x04 | 15252 |  64 |  9893 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_40/8_256          | 0x05 | 24516 |  64 | 18469 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_60/3_256          | 0x06 | 16629 |  64 |  8392 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_60/6_256          | 0x07 | 24507 |  64 | 14824 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHA2_60/12_256         | 0x08 | 38095 |  64 | 27688 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_20/2_256         | 0x11 |  5998 |  64 |  4963 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_20/4_256         | 0x12 | 10938 |  64 |  9251 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_40/2_256         | 0x13 |  9600 |  64 |  5605 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_40/4_256         | 0x14 | 15252 |  64 |  9893 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_40/8_256         | 0x15 | 24516 |  64 | 18469 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_60/3_256         | 0x16 | 16629 |  64 |  8392 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_60/6_256         | 0x17 | 24507 |  64 | 14824 | 32 |\r\n| XMSSMT-SHAKE_60/12_256        | 0x18 | 38095 |  64 | 27688 | 32 |\r\n\r\n\r\n7.
