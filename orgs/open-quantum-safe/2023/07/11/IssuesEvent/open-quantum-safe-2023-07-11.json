A similar trigger exists from oqs-openssl111 to oqs-demos. This leads to an inefficient repeated execution of oqs-demos CCI if `liboqs` changes trigger downstream CCI to both `oqs-openssl111` and `oqs-provider`. Can this be improved/are both necessary?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-11T19:52:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
