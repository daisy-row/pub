This may or may not be sensible -- but at least confuses me (why do we still have this file)? If we decide to keep this file, the corresponding image should be built in CI and be used (and not the more generic `aarch64` linux image). Also, would running the code in a comparable (VM-based) manner be possible? In which infrastructure? How do we ascertain that the functionality being tested on all platforms remains in sync with the main `Dockerfile` (used for `x64`)?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/comments/1654185592","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/103#issuecomment-1654185592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/103","id":1654185592,"node_id":"IC_kwDOETYnOM5imN54","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-27T18:26:01Z","updated_at":"2023-07-27T18:26:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I ran tests today on the M1 machine using both a Docker image built locally and a Docker image built in CI.
