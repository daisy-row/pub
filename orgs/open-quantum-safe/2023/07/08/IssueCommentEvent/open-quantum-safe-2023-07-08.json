Please review these requirements:\r\n\r\nContributors guide: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING\r\n\r\nOther than that, provide a description above this comment if there isn't one already\r\n\r\nIf this fixes a github issue, make sure to have a line saying 'Fixes #XXXX' (without quotes) in the commit message.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the challenges faced by users during the installation process by introducing a Dockerized environment for the project. The aim is to provide a consistent and reliable setup that mitigates issues arising from differences in user environments.The installation process of the project in local can encounter various difficulties due to differences in operating systems, dependencies, and configurations across users' environments. These discrepancies could lead to be challenging for users to get the project up and running smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Added a Dockerfile that builds the project's environment based on the Python 3.9 Alpine image. It installs the required dependencies. The Dockerfile also sets the working directory and clones the necessary repositories (openssl and liboqs), compiling and installing them.\r\n\r\n* Created a docker-compose.yml file that defines the services and volumes for the Docker container. The shared volume is configured to link the host and the container, ensuring that generated files are accessible outside the container.\r\n\r\n* Instruction for OpenSSL commands on the Docker container.\r\n\r\nThese changes provide users with an easy and reproducible way to set up and run the project in a Docker environment. The Dockerized environment ensures consistent execution and simplifies the installation process.\r\n\r\n##### Checklist\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.

I'm afraid it comes a bit too late: We had such image in docker hub in the image [openquantumsafe/curl](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/curl/general) (generated from https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/tree/main/curl) but replaced this by now with the more future-proof OpenSSL3 version (given the [EOL notice for (oqs)openssl111](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/releases)). If you'd like to try it, it still is accessible under the \":0.7.2\" tag.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, would you possibly consider checking out https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3/general (and the generating code at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/tree/main/openssl3) to state improvements missing there (and maybe add them via PR there)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/1627451045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-07-08T18:18:39Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
