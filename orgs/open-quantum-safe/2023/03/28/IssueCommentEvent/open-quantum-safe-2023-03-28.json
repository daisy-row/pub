Clone, build, and install this provider (don't forget to edit `openssl.cnf` as appropriate).\r\n4. `mkdir -p openssl/apps; ln -s /opt/local/bin/openssl openssl/apps`\r\n5.

(never tried -- see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/46) -- I could try to debug into this on a remote M1, now that I think about it... Would you be willing to share instructions or a script how you built everything on OSX? Any suggestions as to which command line tools (I have ssh access only) exist on OSX for debugging into this (`gdb` style)? Just looking at the stack trace, though, I have a nagging feeling this is an OpenSSL issue: There's no reason why `oqsprovider` would trigger (loading) `gostprovider`....\r\n\r\n> Note: commenting out, e.g., GOST provider in openssl.cnf did not help.\r\n\r\nBut this cannot be: What code then triggers the load of `gostprovider` in the stack trace above? Could you please try to simply disable gostprovider from being loaded (e.g., `chmod gou-rwx gostprovider*`)? Sorry for the \"guessworks\" -- I never saw all of these providers running at the same time....

As agreed in [Issue #136](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/136) we ought to update the names. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes two commits\r\n- [Commit #16c98d1](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pull/138/commits/16c98d1f34b7d38d2fa792e520e16a5913acf65e) updates just the three method names which are in [the draft](https://github.com/csosto-pk/pq-ssh/blob/master/draft-kampanakis-ssh-pq-ke.txt). If you want to reject the second commit in this PR, feel free to just take this one.\r\n- [Commit #5fd6eab](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pull/138/commits/5fd6eabe5614e5ba5f26a572b73bbcb6c41b9dcb) updates the rest of the PQ-hybrid key exchange method names. \r\n  - It does not use `-d00` as these are not in the draft.\r\n  - It uses `-r2` for Frodo since it was not picker in Round 3. For the rest it uses `-r3`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1487533517","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/pull/138#issuecomment-1487533517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/138","id":1487533517,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV85YqfXN","user":{"login":"christianpaquin","id":16247285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ3Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin","html_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christianpaquin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-28T20:12:19Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T20:12:19Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"We can merge this first, and then update libssh (see [discussion here](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/libssh/issues/18#issuecomment-1487502973)).
