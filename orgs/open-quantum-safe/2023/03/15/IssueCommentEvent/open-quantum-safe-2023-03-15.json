That is probably because that it was done previously as per RFC4253 and because the exchanged ECDH shared key is a big integer and `K` ended up being `mpint`. \r\n- `K = HASH((PQ shared key) || (ECDH shared key))` is used as a `byte` array for deriving encryption keys for SSH https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/92c59cf2f25fb32b21ce8d7b11a8af246ea17062/kexoqsecdh.c#L94 \r\n\r\nThe PQ SSH draft is currently a little ambiguous on this, and I will update it to be more prescriptive, but we want to make a suggestion here to make sure we are all implementers on the same page: \r\n\r\nBoth ```PQ shared key``` and ```ECDH shared key``` would rather be a simple `byte` array padded to the nearest byte boundary. Previously `mpint` worked because ```ECDH shared key``` was going directly into `K`, but that is not the case any more. ```PQ shared key``` and ```ECDH shared key``` go into a hash, so they ought to be raw data, fixed-length, simple `byte` array padded to the nearest byte boundary. Using `mpint` for one shared key and raw data for the other is inconsistent and `mpint` adds some predictability into the content of the hash input buffer. \r\n\r\nBtw, that is what OpenSSH does with its X25519+SNTRU PQ-hybrid key exchange method. \r\n\r\n@dstebila , @baentsch , @christianpaquin , what do you think?
