But I fail to see a behavioural change in the code, so am I assuming right that it will fail in the same way if the OIDs between qsc-encoding lib and oqs-provider go out of sync again? Also, wouldn't it be more professional to have tests for this (both good and negative expected behaviour)? \r\n\r\nIt will not silently fail anymore. Good point with the test, I can add a negative test (show that the tests fail if a unknown encoding is set via env var).\r\n\r\n> Finally, is such duplication of OIDs between oqs-provider and qsc-encoder really necessary (or at the very least cannot be overruled at the API level)? It creates an undue dependency that we've just fallen into -- and can fall into again if I read [Quantum-Safe-Collaboration/qsc-key-encoder@d7970ea](https://github.com/Quantum-Safe-Collaboration/qsc-key-encoder/commit/d7970eaa874182aec042e474b7c78316c82332d2) correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's the best solution. How would you overrule at API level?\r\nThere needs to be a unique key to match. Another way the API supports is lookup by algorithm name. Here the issue is that the names are not really well defined, e.g, OQS name: `SPHINCS+-SHAKE256-128s-robust` and the name used in the reference implementation: `sphincs-shake256-128s-robust`. The names also don't identify the algorithm version. OIDs seem to define things more uniquely (ideally there will be a OID repo to pull from). The Falcon OID change was unrelated to key encoding (but signatures changed). Next time the key encoding could change which would require a new IETF draft revision.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1483897951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-25T19:01:32Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
