With these changes (to the creation of certificates), `openvpn` properly starts (both for \"rsa\" as well as any OQS signature algorithm) -- but only if the debug level is set to 0 (\"verb 0\" in both client and server config): The reason is that the debug message for \"Control Channel:\" triggers an error in OpenSSLv3 (not properly displaying a provided signature algorithm).\r\n\r\nthank you this is working.\r\ni have a question about that. \r\n\r\nwhy does this error not happen when I use **opensslv3 with classic signature**, and this problem exists only with **OQS signatures** ??? (when verb 5)\r\n\r\nThis option (verb) is only for showing openvpn connection details.\r\nsomething is weird and this error shouldn't happen.
