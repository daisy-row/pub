Previously `mpint` worked because ```ECDH shared key``` was going directly into `K`, but that is not the case any more. ```PQ shared key``` and ```ECDH shared key``` go into a hash, so they ought to be raw data, fixed-length, simple `byte` array padded to the nearest byte boundary. Using `mpint` for one shared key and raw data for the other is inconsistent and `mpint` adds some predictability into the content of the hash input buffer. \r\n\r\nBtw, that is what OpenSSH does with its X25519+SNTRU PQ-hybrid key exchange method. \r\n\r\n@dstebila , @baentsch , @christianpaquin , what do you think?

I've updated #138 to use our templating method and put the relevant method names in a few more places.\r\n\r\n>       * It does not use `-d00` as these are not in the draft.\r\n\r\nThey're not in the draft, but it does use the hybridization method in the draft.  I'm torn on which way to go for these.\r\n\r\n>       * It uses `-r2` for Frodo since it was not picker in Round 3. For the rest it uses `-r3`.\r\n\r\nFrodoKEM was a round 3 alternate.  That being said, FrodoKEM didn't change from Round 2 to Round 3, so r2 is a fine moniker to use.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1472096749/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-16T14:33:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
