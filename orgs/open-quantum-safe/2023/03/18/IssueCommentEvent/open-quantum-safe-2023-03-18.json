Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1474831071","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/123#issuecomment-1474831071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/123","id":1474831071,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l85X6CLf","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-18T12:07:24Z","updated_at":"2023-03-18T12:07:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> Will add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nWiki documentation does not help people who just use a release build; also it becomes stale, so please document (at least the above) within github repo.\r\n\r\nAlso, the oqs-provider version information does not contain a hint as to what encoding is actually used in the built binary.
