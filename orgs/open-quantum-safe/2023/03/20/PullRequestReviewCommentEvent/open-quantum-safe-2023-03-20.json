encoding subjectPublicKey and privateKey according the following IETF drafts:\r\n\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium/00/\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-uni-qsckeys-falcon/00/\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-uni-qsckeys-kyber/00/\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-uni-qsckeys-sphincsplus/00/\r\n\r\n- Integrates encoding library from https://github.com/Quantum-Safe-Collaboration/qsc-key-rfc/tree/main/qsc-key-encoder.\r\nThe code is used as an external project with cmake `ExternalProject_Add`. Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89

Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89

Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89

Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89

An advantage of the IETF drafts implemented in this PR is that the private keys are structured to have an OPTIONAL public key.

Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89
