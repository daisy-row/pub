All PQ algs are available via OpenSSLv3 via [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) --- without any PQ-specific changes to OpenSSL. A PR adding PHP to our PQ-integrations in [oqs-demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) would be most welcome --- if at all necessary: Maybe all you need to do is run PHP with OpenSSLv3 and activate `oqs-provider` via an entry in `openssl.cnf`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssl/issues/comments/1467800821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-14T10:12:46Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
