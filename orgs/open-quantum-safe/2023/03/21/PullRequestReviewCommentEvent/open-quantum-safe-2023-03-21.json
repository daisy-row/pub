Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89

Optionally, oqs-provider can be built without the dependency by using `-DUSE_ENCODING_LIB=OFF`. The library provides API to encode/decode according to the draft specification.\r\n\r\n- The encodings are specified by setting environment variables. Example: `export OQS_ENCODING_DILITHIUM2=draft-uni-qsckeys-dilithium-00/sk-pk`. If no env variable are set, the default is 'no' encoding (the previous oqs-provider behavior).\r\n\r\n- Supports the `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY` build option (#83). \r\nNote: some PQC algorithms (Kyber, SPHINCS+) already contain the public key in their 'raw' private key. With `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`, this usually leads to an unnecessary duplication of the public key. The encodings according to the IETF drafts avoid this duplication even if `-DNOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY=OFF`.\r\n\r\n- Adds CI test runs (with / without encodings set, with / without NOPUBKEY_IN_PRIVKEY)\r\n\r\nWill add config options to Wiki if merged.\r\n\r\nFixes #89
