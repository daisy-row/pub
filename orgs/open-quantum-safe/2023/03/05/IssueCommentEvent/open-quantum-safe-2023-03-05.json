As the docker file includes go test, if the buildx success with s390, which means it functional works on s390 isn't it?\r\n\r\nYes, if the test is run OK on CircleCI the pointer to @brivu is not necessary and I apologize for notifying him.\r\n\r\nHowever, so far, all I found is a run log on GitHub CI, nothing on CircleCI: https://github.com/SamYuan1990/liboqs-go/actions/runs/4333874827/jobs/7567365625.\r\n\r\nIn there, I'm also wondering why there is no output of the test execution itself: I'd expect lines showing \"Correctness etc.\" for all algorithms, but can't find anything. Lastly, when building and running the Dockerfile locally (only for x86_64) no tests are logged as run during build but test output is shown only [when executing the container]( https://github.com/SamYuan1990/liboqs-go/blob/4b37b1eae6cfbf6f7018a3fcd505f7e742973d29/docker/Dockerfile#L23).\r\n\r\nI'm no \"Gopher\", so may be misunderstanding something here -- but some logfile-documented success would help me see that everything is good here: Can you please point to/post a link to such successful CI test run logs (on all platforms)?\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: If this runs successful on GitHub CI, I'd be happy. If all currently supported platforms are running in GitHub CI (have you confirmed the x-built \"linux/arm64\" image run OK on OSX?) we could move CI away from CircleCI and its limitations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/issues/comments/1455002183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-05T06:19:53Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

From CI parts... there one thing sounds need current maintainer's help, as token to access docker hub....\r\n\r\nIf I understand you right, (to push the images to docker hub?), please first automate everything to work with your own docker hub account (e.g., setting \"samyuan1990/go\" in https://github.com/SamYuan1990/liboqs-go/blob/4b37b1eae6cfbf6f7018a3fcd505f7e742973d29/.github/workflows/build.yml#L39). If this works, we can then automate to push to \"openquantumsafe/go\". I therefore suggested using a variable for the target docker repository: In your github context it would point to your docker hub account and in the \"open-quantum-safe\" github context it would point to the \"openquantumsafe\" docker hub account. Same things with docker hub credentials (to successfully push): You should use yours in your environment (to see everything works) and we can add openquantumsafe ones when everything then is built in the `main` branch of `open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go`...\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/issues/comments/1455014047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-05T07:35:07Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
