As we are working through this, we will all try to interop with the ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```. It is supported in OQS OpenSSH and wolfSSH, which is great. \r\n\r\nNow there is one concern about backwards compatibility. Someone that implements the method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` today may have interop issues in a couple of years when Kyber has been slightly tweaked or something in the method has been tweaked in the draft and the peer implements the latest version. That is a concern for any RFC draft which changes over time. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such problems we could introduce a temporary identifier that basically creates a snapshot of the method in time. For example, we could rename ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` to method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00```. That basically means the method is specific to the time it was implemented (Kyber-512 round 3 the way draft -00 explained the method). In the next change which breaks compatibility for that method, its name will change to something like ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-d01``` or something like that. So, old clients that were not upgraded would not be able to negotiate ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00``` any more and they would still interop using classical methods. When the RFC is ratified, the final standardized name would be ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```\r\n\r\nI know this is not something we have done for TLS 1.3 group names, or SSH methods. But have you given it any thought? Would it be too much overhead to rename the method every time something underlying (KEM algorithm, or implementation detail) changes?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-08T20:57:11Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
