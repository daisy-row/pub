sorry for seeing your response only now. So the openssl build seems OK  and even the dilithium2 verification is OK, right? Just to be sure, can you confirm connecting to a falcon port, say 6594, using openssl also works?! In that case we definitely have an OpenVPN-only issue -- which would be weird because there is no oqs-specific code in it... \r\n\r\nCan you please share all steps you did do generate the error trace at the start so I can reproduce? For example, are you 100% certain that you have a correct `openssl.cnf` file, for example? Please share its contents here: I currently have the assumption that this script has not been correctly executed on your side:\r\n```\r\nsed -i \"s/default = default_sect/default = default_sect\\noqsprovider = oqsprovider_sect/g\" /opt/oqssa/ssl/openssl.cnf && sed -i \"s/\\[default_sect\\]/\\[default_sect\\]\\nactivate = 1\\n\\[oqsprovider_sect\\]\\nactivate = 1\\n/g\" /opt/oqssa/ssl/openssl.cnf && sed -i \"s/providers = provider_sect/providers = provider_sect\\nssl_conf = ssl_sect\\n\\n\\[ssl_sect\\]\\nsystem_default = system_default_sect\\n\\n\\[system_default_sect\\]\\nGroups = ${KEM_ALGLIST}\\n/g\" /opt/oqssa/ssl/openssl.cnf\r\n```\r\nThe result would be that openvpn does not activate the oqsprovider at all. A correct `openssl.cnf` _must_ contain the lines\r\n```\r\n[provider_sect]\r\ndefault = default_sect\r\noqsprovider = oqsprovider_sect\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n[oqsprovider_sect]\r\nactivate = 1\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/issues/comments/1455536644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-03-06T06:37:19Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
