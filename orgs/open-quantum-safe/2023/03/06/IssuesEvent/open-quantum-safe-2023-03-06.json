All this --also due to very long CI run times-- by now cost me 2 hours and I am unwilling to invest more time to debug & work around these issues. Please let me know whether you'd be willing to fix this issue, #1406, and find the CBOM-generation error in #1405, currently visible in [the error log](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/4273832035/jobs/7440002427).
