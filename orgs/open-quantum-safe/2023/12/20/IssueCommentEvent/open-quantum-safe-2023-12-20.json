They are summarized below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/sampling_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nThis appears to be triggered by the array access `pos_qw[j]`. After reviewing the function's code, I believe this to be a false positive and have documented it as a \"pass\". There's an existing pass for the AVX2 version of this function.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/decode_portable.c#L40\r\n\r\nThe issue here seems to be the \"<\" operator. I changed this to `!(bits >> 6)` and it now passes (on my machine).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L45\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L50\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L51\r\n\r\nThese array accesses depend on the value of `a0`, which is one of the function arguments. Hence, I believe this to be (possible) secret-dependent behaviour. I added short loops to perform the array access in a secret-independent fashion, as is done [in HQC](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/hqc/pqclean_hqc-128_clean/gf2x.c#L49).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, the constant-time tests pass for all variants of BIKE on my machine.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder). In that directory, there is a custom `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate the existing CMake infrastructure into Zephyr. Furthermore, a Kconfig file is provided to configure the build (and especially the algorithm selection). Finally, the new `OQS_randombytes_external` method is implemented in a small C source file here. \r\n\r\nAs this is my first PR for this project, I'm not sure if the changes are upstreamable in the current form. But I'm looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTobi","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1863970100","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1621#issuecomment-1863970100","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1621","id":1863970100,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5vGe00","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-20T07:21:50Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T07:21:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks again for your contribution, @Frauschi !

They are summarized below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/sampling_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nThis appears to be triggered by the array access `pos_qw[j]`. After reviewing the function's code, I believe this to be a false positive and have documented it as a \"pass\". There's an existing pass for the AVX2 version of this function.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/decode_portable.c#L40\r\n\r\nThe issue here seems to be the \"<\" operator. I changed this to `!(bits >> 6)` and it now passes (on my machine).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L45\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L50\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L51\r\n\r\nThese array accesses depend on the value of `a0`, which is one of the function arguments. Hence, I believe this to be (possible) secret-dependent behaviour. I added short loops to perform the array access in a secret-independent fashion, as is done [in HQC](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/hqc/pqclean_hqc-128_clean/gf2x.c#L49).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, the constant-time tests pass for all variants of BIKE on my machine.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
