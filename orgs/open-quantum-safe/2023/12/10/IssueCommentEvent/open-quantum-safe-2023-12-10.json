The applications can replace the implementation by providing custom callback functions for with `OQS_AES_set_callbacks`, `OQS_SHA2_set_callbacks`,\r\n`OQS_SHA3_set_callbacks`, and `OQS_SHA3_x4_callbacks`.\r\n\r\nThis also switches to using dlopen to load OpenSSL (libcrypto.so.*), so that the existing applications wouldn't need to relink with multiple support libraries.\r\n\r\nI'm marking this as draft as it is largely incomplete and has the following portability concerns:\r\n- This relies on `__typeof__` keyword to define redirection symbols\r\n- Only libcrypto.so.3 is supported; we could try libcrypto.so.1\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
