More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.9.1 of liboqs. It was released on December 22, 2023.\r\n\r\nThis release is a security release which fixes potential non-constant-time behaviour in Kyber based on https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/dda29cc63af721981ee2c831cf00822e69be3220\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.9.0 release of liboqs.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- Kyber: C, AVX2, and aarch64 implementation updated\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* pull kyber from upstream: dda29cc63af721981ee2c831cf00822e69be3220 (#1631) by @dstebila in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1633\r\n* Apply patch to Kyber aarch64 code from PQClean for variable-time division issue -> targeting 0.9.1 by @bhess in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1637\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/compare/0.9.0...0.9.1","mentions_count":2,"mentions":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","login":"bhess","profile_name":"Basil Hess","profile_url":"https://github.com/bhess","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","login":"dstebila","profile_name":"Douglas Stebila","profile_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","avatar_user_actor":true}],"short_description_html":"<h1>liboqs version 0.9.1</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
