This change was made as part of the following [PR](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/080c3dd2703a6b26f0aca12b265346a15f87c43e), where previously `openssl@3` pointed to `openssl v3.0.x` which was causing errors trying to build oqs-provider. So the change was made to specify `openssl@3.1`. OpenSSL v3.2 was released last week and the circleci jobs for macOS started failing since `openssl@3.1` is no longer available to install using homebrew. Instead the following are the options: `openssl@3` (which points to the current stable version, v3.2), `openssl@3.0` and `openssl@1.1`.\r\n\r\nChanges made in this PR include:\r\n- pointing the openssl version back to `openssl@3` since it now points to the latest 3.2\r\n- a small doc change to the CONTRIBUTING doc to update the circleci command to run a specific job locally. (This command no longer accepts the --job option)\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-29T20:00:11Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T17:42:39Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf3949bf3be0214f7c6f895eb101357963308525","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/statuses/b4c8bfdf9a198d22e8af0e1959ce58c26f3b21f0","head":{"label":"johnma14:fix-ci-mac-openssl","ref":"fix-ci-mac-openssl","sha":"b4c8bfdf9a198d22e8af0e1959ce58c26f3b21f0","user":{"login":"johnma14","id":11314322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE0MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11314322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14","html_url":"https://github.com/johnma14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":724776104,"node_id":"R_kgDOKzM0qA","name":"oqs-provider","full_name":"johnma14/oqs-provider","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johnma14","id":11314322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzE0MzIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11314322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14","html_url":"https://github.com/johnma14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnma14/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johnma14/oqs-provider","description":"OpenSSL
