However, as far as I can tell the only changes were to whitespace, so I'm still a little perplexed by the sudden breakage.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, it looks like at least some of the failures are indeed non-constant-time behaviour. [The first one](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/6992637406/job/19024477997#step:6:192), for example, points to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/78e65bf143edeceae3179c40b511e1313621ffde/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_avx2/keygen.c#L4153 which I believe we would consider a \"pass\", based on the in-line documentation.\r\n\r\nI'll be updating the Falcon code shortly to address #1561 / https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/523 / #1608, so I suggest we delay fixing this after that's done. No sense in possibly having to update the constant-time issues / passes all over again after it lands. How does that sound @baentsch?\r\n\r\nNot directly related to the Falcon failures, but worth noting: It seems like the \"generic\" run is [picking up errors in the `AVX2` functions](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/6992637406/job/19024477997#step:6:947).

This change was made as part of the following [PR](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/080c3dd2703a6b26f0aca12b265346a15f87c43e), where previously `openssl@3` pointed to `openssl v3.0.x` which was causing errors trying to build oqs-provider. So the change was made to specify `openssl@3.1`. OpenSSL v3.2 was released last week and the circleci jobs for macOS started failing since `openssl@3.1` is no longer available to install using homebrew. Instead the following are the options: `openssl@3` (which points to the current stable version, v3.2), `openssl@3.0` and `openssl@1.1`.\r\n\r\nChanges made in this PR include:\r\n- pointing the openssl version back to `openssl@3` since it now points to the latest 3.2\r\n- a small doc change to the CONTRIBUTING doc to update the circleci command to run a specific job locally. (This command no longer accepts the --job option)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1836931377","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/305#issuecomment-1836931377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305","id":1836931377,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l85tfVkx","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-01T23:47:44Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T23:47:44Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please rebase to latest main and CI should turn green.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1836931377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-01T23:47:45Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
