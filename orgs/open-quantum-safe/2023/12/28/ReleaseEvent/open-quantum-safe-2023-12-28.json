oqs-provider 0.5.3\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nThe **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**oqs-provider** is a standalone [OpenSSL 3](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)-based quantum-safe and [hybrid key exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology) for TLS 1.3, as well as quantum-safe and hybrid X.509 certificate generation, CMS, CMP and `dgst` (signature) operations.\r\n\r\nWhen deployed, the `oqs-provider` binary (shared library) thus adds support for quantum-safe cryptographic operations to any standard OpenSSL(v3) installation. The ultimate goal is that all `openssl` functionality shall be [PQC-enabled](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).\r\n\r\nIn general, the oqs-provider `main` branch is meant to be usable in conjunction with the `main` branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and the `master` branch of [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).\r\n\r\nFurther details on building, testing and use can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.5.3 of oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n### Security considerations\r\n\r\nThis improves a non-constant time issue in previous releases for Kyber.\r\n\r\n### What's New\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.5.2 release of oqs-provider and is fully tested to be used in conjunction with the main branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs). This release is functionally guaranteed to be in sync with v0.9.1 of `liboqs` (see note below),\r\n\r\nThis release also makes available ready-to-run binaries for Linux (.so), Windows (.dll) and MacOS (.dylib) compiled for `x64` CPUs. Activation and use is documented in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/USAGE.md).\r\n\r\n### Additional new feature highlights\r\n\r\n- Kyber code update addressing constant time property\r\n- Code point updates for HQC following code updates in `liboqs`\r\n- Document project governance\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Clarify liboqs_DIR naming convention by @ajbozarth in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/292\r\n* check empty params lists passed by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/296\r\n* Fix minor typos in documentation by @johnma14 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/304\r\n* HQC code point update by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/306\r\n* Fix broken circleci job for macOS by @johnma14 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/305\r\n* Contribution policy by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/286\r\n* Fix link in GOVERNANCE.md [skip ci] by @pi-314159 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/309\r\n* Add a example of how to load oqsprovider using `OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin`. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/308\r\n* Get Windows CI to work again by @qnfm in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/310\r\n* correct upstream and Windows CI snafus by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/322\r\n\r\n## Release-specific note\r\n\r\nDue to an incomplete cherry-pick in `liboqs`, the code-generator logic in `oqsprovider` does produce incorrect documentation when used in conjunction with `liboqs` release 0.9.1. The corresponding CI test therefore is disabled for this `oqsprovider` release and this note has been created to warn users of this inconsistency in `liboqs` v0.9.1. It has no functional implications.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ajbozarth made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/292\r\n* @johnma14 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/304\r\n* @pi-314159 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/309\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/compare/0.5.2...0.5.3","mentions_count":6,"mentions":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11314322?v=4","login":"johnma14","profile_name":"Mariam John","profile_url":"https://github.com/johnma14","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","login":"ajbozarth","profile_name":"Alex Bozarth","profile_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","login":"baentsch","profile_name":"Michael Baentsch","profile_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74706004?v=4","login":"pi-314159","profile_name":"PI","profile_url":"https://github.com/pi-314159","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104289862?v=4","login":"qnfm","profile_name":null,"profile_url":"https://github.com/qnfm","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108470890?v=4","login":"thb-sb","profile_name":"thomas","profile_url":"https://github.com/thb-sb","avatar_user_actor":true}],"short_description_html":"<h1>oqs-provider 0.5.3</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
