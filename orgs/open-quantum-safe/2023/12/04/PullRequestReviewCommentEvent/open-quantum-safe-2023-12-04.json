All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder). In that directory, there is a custom `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate the existing CMake infrastructure into Zephyr. Furthermore, a Kconfig file is provided to configure the build (and especially the algorithm selection). Finally, the new `OQS_randombytes_external` method is implemented in a small C source file here. \r\n\r\nAs this is my first PR for this project, I'm not sure if the changes are upstreamable in the current form. But I'm looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTobi","created_at":"2023-12-04T08:07:27Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T11:59:26Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c77fb2661ba0c1cfb84a05351f6bd9bd4c9f78ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/2663a8eb10c1c50451fdc60509644a709ab11035","head":{"label":"Frauschi:main","ref":"main","sha":"2663a8eb10c1c50451fdc60509644a709ab11035","user":{"login":"Frauschi","id":5159151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTkxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5159151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi","html_url":"https://github.com/Frauschi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":721127347,"node_id":"R_kgDOKvuHsw","name":"liboqs","full_name":"Frauschi/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Frauschi","id":5159151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTkxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5159151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi","html_url":"https://github.com/Frauschi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Frauschi/liboqs","description":"C

All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder). In that directory, there is a custom `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate the existing CMake infrastructure into Zephyr. Furthermore, a Kconfig file is provided to configure the build (and especially the algorithm selection). Finally, the new `OQS_randombytes_external` method is implemented in a small C source file here. \r\n\r\nAs this is my first PR for this project, I'm not sure if the changes are upstreamable in the current form. But I'm looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTobi","created_at":"2023-12-04T08:07:27Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T12:09:43Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c77fb2661ba0c1cfb84a05351f6bd9bd4c9f78ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/statuses/2663a8eb10c1c50451fdc60509644a709ab11035","head":{"label":"Frauschi:main","ref":"main","sha":"2663a8eb10c1c50451fdc60509644a709ab11035","user":{"login":"Frauschi","id":5159151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTkxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5159151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi","html_url":"https://github.com/Frauschi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":721127347,"node_id":"R_kgDOKvuHsw","name":"liboqs","full_name":"Frauschi/liboqs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Frauschi","id":5159151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTkxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5159151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi","html_url":"https://github.com/Frauschi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frauschi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Frauschi/liboqs","description":"C

The CI system builds and tests binary versions for each tier 1 target to make sure any change does not negatively affect those platforms. Platform-specific build documentation must exist.\n+\n+### Tier 2\n+\n+Tier 2 targets can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build\". The `liboqs` CI system contains builds for each tier 2 target; testing may or may not be available (typically depending on CI system platform availability). Therefore, tier 2 targets often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Tier 2 targets may also have known deficiencies caused by a lack of expertise to fix those on a given platform. Again, help and PRs to move platforms from tier 2 to tier 1 are always welcome.\n+\n+### Tier 3\n+\n+Tier 3 targets are those which the `liboqs` codebase has support for, but which the CI system does not build or test automatically, so they may or may not work. Platform-specific build documentation should exist.\n+\n+## Platform tier policy\n+\n+Tier 2 and tier 1 targets place work on `liboqs` core project developers as a whole, to avoid breaking the target. The broader `liboqs` community may also feel more inclined to support higher-tier targets in their work. Thus, these tiers require commensurate and ongoing efforts from the maintainers of the target, to demonstrate value and to minimize any disruptions to ongoing `liboqs` development.\n+\n+This policy defines the requirements for accepting a proposed target at a given level of support.\n+\n+Each tier builds on all the requirements from the previous tier, unless overridden by a stronger requirement.\n+\n+Change of tier is subject to approval by the `liboqs` technical governance team.  This team is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the target, based on these requirements and their own judgment. The tea may apply additional requirements, including subjective requirements, such as to deal with issues not foreseen by this policy. (Such requirements may subsequently motivate additions to this policy.)\n+\n+While these criteria attempt to document the policy, that policy still involves human judgment. Targets must fulfill the spirit of the requirements as well, as determined by the judgment of the approving team. Reviewers and team members evaluating targets and target-specific patches should always use their own best judgment regarding the quality of work, and the suitability of a target for the `liboqs` project. Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets shall create any binding agreement or estoppel by any party.\n+\n+Before filing an issue or pull request (PR) to introduce or promote a target, the target should already meet the corresponding tier requirements. This does not preclude an existing target's maintainers using issues (on the `liboqs` repository or otherwise) to track requirements that have not yet been met, as appropriate; however, before officially proposing the introduction or promotion of a target, it should meet all of the necessary requirements. A target proposal must quote the corresponding requirements verbatim and respond to them as part of explaining how the target meets those requirements. (For the requirements that simply state that the target or the target developers must not do something, it suffices to acknowledge the requirement.)\n+\n+Several parts of this policy require providing target-specific documentation. Such documentation should typically appear in a subdirectory of the platform-support section of the `liboqs` manual, with a link from the target's entry in platform support.\n+\n+Note that a target must have already received approval for the next lower tier, and spent a reasonable amount of time at that tier, before making a proposal for promotion to the next higher tier; this is true even if a target meets the requirements for several tiers at once. This policy leaves the precise interpretation of \"reasonable amount of time\" up to the approving team; the team may scale the amount of time required based on their confidence in the target and its demonstrated track record at its current tier. At a minimum, multiple stable releases of `liboqs` should typically occur between promotions of a target.\n+\n+The availability or tier of a target in stable `liboqs` is not a hard stability guarantee about the future availability or tier of that target. Higher-level target tiers are an increasing commitment to the support of a target, and we will take that commitment and potential disruptions into account when evaluating the potential demotion or removal of a target that has been part of a stable release. The promotion or demotion of a target will not generally affect existing stable releases, only current development and future releases.\n+\n+In this policy, the words \"must\" and \"must not\" specify absolute requirements that a target must meet to qualify for a tier. The words \"should\" and \"should not\" specify requirements that apply in almost all cases, but for which the approving teams may grant an exception for good reason. The word \"may\" indicates something entirely optional, and does not indicate guidance or recommendations.

The CI system builds and tests binary versions for each tier 1 target to make sure any change does not negatively affect those platforms. Platform-specific build documentation must exist.\n+\n+### Tier 2\n+\n+Tier 2 targets can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build\". The `liboqs` CI system contains builds for each tier 2 target; testing may or may not be available (typically depending on CI system platform availability). Therefore, tier 2 targets often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Tier 2 targets may also have known deficiencies caused by a lack of expertise to fix those on a given platform. Again, help and PRs to move platforms from tier 2 to tier 1 are always welcome.\n+\n+### Tier 3\n+\n+Tier 3 targets are those which the `liboqs` codebase has support for, but which the CI system does not build or test automatically, so they may or may not work. Platform-specific build documentation should exist.\n+\n+## Platform tier policy\n+\n+Tier 2 and tier 1 targets place work on `liboqs` core project developers as a whole, to avoid breaking the target. The broader `liboqs` community may also feel more inclined to support higher-tier targets in their work. Thus, these tiers require commensurate and ongoing efforts from the maintainers of the target, to demonstrate value and to minimize any disruptions to ongoing `liboqs` development.\n+\n+This policy defines the requirements for accepting a proposed target at a given level of support.\n+\n+Each tier builds on all the requirements from the previous tier, unless overridden by a stronger requirement.\n+\n+Change of tier is subject to approval by the `liboqs` technical governance team.  This team is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the target, based on these requirements and their own judgment. The tea may apply additional requirements, including subjective requirements, such as to deal with issues not foreseen by this policy. (Such requirements may subsequently motivate additions to this policy.)\n+\n+While these criteria attempt to document the policy, that policy still involves human judgment. Targets must fulfill the spirit of the requirements as well, as determined by the judgment of the approving team. Reviewers and team members evaluating targets and target-specific patches should always use their own best judgment regarding the quality of work, and the suitability of a target for the `liboqs` project. Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets shall create any binding agreement or estoppel by any party.\n+\n+Before filing an issue or pull request (PR) to introduce or promote a target, the target should already meet the corresponding tier requirements. This does not preclude an existing target's maintainers using issues (on the `liboqs` repository or otherwise) to track requirements that have not yet been met, as appropriate; however, before officially proposing the introduction or promotion of a target, it should meet all of the necessary requirements. A target proposal must quote the corresponding requirements verbatim and respond to them as part of explaining how the target meets those requirements. (For the requirements that simply state that the target or the target developers must not do something, it suffices to acknowledge the requirement.)\n+\n+Several parts of this policy require providing target-specific documentation. Such documentation should typically appear in a subdirectory of the platform-support section of the `liboqs` manual, with a link from the target's entry in platform support.\n+\n+Note that a target must have already received approval for the next lower tier, and spent a reasonable amount of time at that tier, before making a proposal for promotion to the next higher tier; this is true even if a target meets the requirements for several tiers at once. This policy leaves the precise interpretation of \"reasonable amount of time\" up to the approving team; the team may scale the amount of time required based on their confidence in the target and its demonstrated track record at its current tier. At a minimum, multiple stable releases of `liboqs` should typically occur between promotions of a target.\n+\n+The availability or tier of a target in stable `liboqs` is not a hard stability guarantee about the future availability or tier of that target. Higher-level target tiers are an increasing commitment to the support of a target, and we will take that commitment and potential disruptions into account when evaluating the potential demotion or removal of a target that has been part of a stable release. The promotion or demotion of a target will not generally affect existing stable releases, only current development and future releases.\n+\n+In this policy, the words \"must\" and \"must not\" specify absolute requirements that a target must meet to qualify for a tier. The words \"should\" and \"should not\" specify requirements that apply in almost all cases, but for which the approving teams may grant an exception for good reason. The word \"may\" indicates something entirely optional, and does not indicate guidance or recommendations.

It is principally concerned with defining the roles of project contributors, the associated rights and responsibilities, and the process for transitioning between them. As such, this document is written in a fairly formal and precise tone, so as to be succint and unambiguous. This should not be interpreted as a lack of warmth on the part of the OQS team---we're really quite friendly! We do not intend to act as gatekeepers by laying out this tier of roles and the associated rules. Instead, we hope that clearly defining these roles and the processes for attaining them shows contributors a clear path by which to become more involved in project governance, if they so wish. We welcome all questions, discussions, and contributions, and we would love to have more people on board.\n+\n+We recognize that some of the policies discussed here can seem intimidating---for instance, revocation of privileges or code of conduct violations. It is our hope that we don't have to rely on these guidelines; however, we believe that it is important to have them in place should they be needed.\n+\n+## Roles\n+\n+The following roles exist in the project:\n+\n+1. Maintainer: Person with GitHub administrative rights.\n+\n+2. Committer: Person with GitHub \"Write\" privileges; this entails the right and obligation to review PRs by Contributors and to actively participate in discussions.\n+\n+3. Contributor: Person that has contributed code.\n+\n+4. Users: Person using the project passively or actively, e.g., by participating in discussions.\n+\n+## Relationships between roles\n+\n+Any User may also be a Contributor. Any Contributor may also be a Committer. Any Committer may also be a Maintainer. A Maintainer must be a Committer.\n+\n+## Change of role\n+\n+Any User may become a Contributor by creating a pull request (PR) and getting it successfully reviewed and merged by Committers.\n+\n+Any Contributor can become a Committer by contributing sufficient code and displaying deep subject matter knowledge in discussions such that a majority of Committers vote for this change of role. A Maintainer can veto such a vote. Such a veto can be overruled by a 2/3 majority of Committers.\n+\n+As such a voting decision may be considered subjective, Contributors striving to become Committers are encouraged to ask for advice by Committers as to what---if anything---should be done to attain this status (additional to already documented knowledge in contributions). Baseline requirements for contributions are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Any Contributor can create a discussion item to request a vote to become Committer.\n+\n+Any Committer can become a Maintainer by majority vote of voting Committers. A current Maintainer can veto such a vote. Such a veto can be overruled by a 2/3 majority of all Committers.\n+\n+A Maintainer is not permitted to remove another Maintainer's GitHub privileges.\n+\n+A Committer may be automatically moved to Contributor status if not actively contributing by discussion or PR review during the last 90 days or by voluntarily suspending this status (e.g., by taking a [\"Leave of absence\"](#leave-of-absence)). If a Maintainer loses or relinquishes the Committer status and, hence, the Maintainer status, the Committers have to determine whether a new Maintainer needs to be elected.\n+\n+Any person violating the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md], consistently not fulfilling the role responsibilities or other reasons can lose the role held if a simple majority of Committers votes for such removal and no Maintainer vetos that decision. If a Maintainer is to be removed from that role a 2/3 majority of Committers must agree.\n+\n+Depending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus status. Emeritus Maintainers may still be consulted on some project matters, and can be returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes and a simple majority of Committers agrees.\n+\n+## Leave of absence\n+\n+Any Committer may voluntarily step down from the role for a documented period of time, losing voting rights for that time period. The period is documented in this file next to the person's name below.  At the end of this time period, the Committer automatically regains their voting rights.\n+\n+A leave of absence may not be longer than a year.  If the Committer needs to be away for longer than that, they must step down from that role unconditionally, and regaining that role becomes subject of normal procedures to become Committer, as described in [\"Change of role\"](#change-of-role) above.","path":"GOVERNANCE.md","commit_id":"13cf309765c5de56a4a6d443e45809338581d29a","original_commit_id":"13cf309765c5de56a4a6d443e45809338581d29a","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"```suggestion\r\nA leave of absence may not be longer than a year.

The CI system builds and tests binary versions for each tier 1 target to make sure any change does not negatively affect those platforms. Platform-specific build documentation must exist.\n+\n+### Tier 2\n+\n+Tier 2 targets can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build\". The `liboqs` CI system contains builds for each tier 2 target; testing may or may not be available (typically depending on CI system platform availability). Therefore, tier 2 targets often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Tier 2 targets may also have known deficiencies caused by a lack of expertise to fix those on a given platform. Again, help and PRs to move platforms from tier 2 to tier 1 are always welcome.\n+\n+### Tier 3\n+\n+Tier 3 targets are those which the `liboqs` codebase has support for, but which the CI system does not build or test automatically, so they may or may not work. Platform-specific build documentation should exist.\n+\n+## Platform tier policy\n+\n+Tier 2 and tier 1 targets place work on `liboqs` core project developers as a whole, to avoid breaking the target. The broader `liboqs` community may also feel more inclined to support higher-tier targets in their work. Thus, these tiers require commensurate and ongoing efforts from the maintainers of the target, to demonstrate value and to minimize any disruptions to ongoing `liboqs` development.\n+\n+This policy defines the requirements for accepting a proposed target at a given level of support.\n+\n+Each tier builds on all the requirements from the previous tier, unless overridden by a stronger requirement.\n+\n+Change of tier is subject to approval by the `liboqs` technical governance team.  This team is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the target, based on these requirements and their own judgment. The tea may apply additional requirements, including subjective requirements, such as to deal with issues not foreseen by this policy. (Such requirements may subsequently motivate additions to this policy.)\n+\n+While these criteria attempt to document the policy, that policy still involves human judgment. Targets must fulfill the spirit of the requirements as well, as determined by the judgment of the approving team. Reviewers and team members evaluating targets and target-specific patches should always use their own best judgment regarding the quality of work, and the suitability of a target for the `liboqs` project. Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets shall create any binding agreement or estoppel by any party.\n+\n+Before filing an issue or pull request (PR) to introduce or promote a target, the target should already meet the corresponding tier requirements. This does not preclude an existing target's maintainers using issues (on the `liboqs` repository or otherwise) to track requirements that have not yet been met, as appropriate; however, before officially proposing the introduction or promotion of a target, it should meet all of the necessary requirements. A target proposal must quote the corresponding requirements verbatim and respond to them as part of explaining how the target meets those requirements. (For the requirements that simply state that the target or the target developers must not do something, it suffices to acknowledge the requirement.)\n+\n+Several parts of this policy require providing target-specific documentation. Such documentation should typically appear in a subdirectory of the platform-support section of the `liboqs` manual, with a link from the target's entry in platform support.\n+\n+Note that a target must have already received approval for the next lower tier, and spent a reasonable amount of time at that tier, before making a proposal for promotion to the next higher tier; this is true even if a target meets the requirements for several tiers at once. This policy leaves the precise interpretation of \"reasonable amount of time\" up to the approving team; the team may scale the amount of time required based on their confidence in the target and its demonstrated track record at its current tier. At a minimum, multiple stable releases of `liboqs` should typically occur between promotions of a target.\n+\n+The availability or tier of a target in stable `liboqs` is not a hard stability guarantee about the future availability or tier of that target. Higher-level target tiers are an increasing commitment to the support of a target, and we will take that commitment and potential disruptions into account when evaluating the potential demotion or removal of a target that has been part of a stable release. The promotion or demotion of a target will not generally affect existing stable releases, only current development and future releases.\n+\n+In this policy, the words \"must\" and \"must not\" specify absolute requirements that a target must meet to qualify for a tier. The words \"should\" and \"should not\" specify requirements that apply in almost all cases, but for which the approving teams may grant an exception for good reason. The word \"may\" indicates something entirely optional, and does not indicate guidance or recommendations. This language is based on [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).\n+\n+## Platforms supported\n+\n+### Tier 1\n+\n+- x86_64/amd64/x64 for Ubuntu Linux (Focal) and MacOS (XCode 14)\n+- aarch64 for Ubuntu (Focal)\n+- armhf/ARM7 and aarch64 emulation on Ubuntu\n+- ppc64le for Ubuntu (Focal)\n+- s390x for Ubuntu (Focal)\n+\n+### Tier 2\n+\n+- x86_64/amd64/x64 for Windows 2022\n+- armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64 for Android\n+- OS64, TVOS for Apple Mobile\n+\n+### Tier 3\n+\n+- x86 for Windows\n+- aarch64 for MacOS","path":"PLATFORMS.md","commit_id":"c47dbacb7c012598816fbc705e28348839725b1f","original_commit_id":"c47dbacb7c012598816fbc705e28348839725b1f","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"Agreed.

The CI system builds and tests binary versions for each tier 1 target to make sure any change does not negatively affect those platforms. Platform-specific build documentation must exist.\n+\n+### Tier 2\n+\n+Tier 2 targets can be thought of as \"guaranteed to build\". The `liboqs` CI system contains builds for each tier 2 target; testing may or may not be available (typically depending on CI system platform availability). Therefore, tier 2 targets often work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Tier 2 targets may also have known deficiencies caused by a lack of expertise to fix those on a given platform. Again, help and PRs to move platforms from tier 2 to tier 1 are always welcome.\n+\n+### Tier 3\n+\n+Tier 3 targets are those which the `liboqs` codebase has support for, but which the CI system does not build or test automatically, so they may or may not work. Platform-specific build documentation should exist.\n+\n+## Platform tier policy\n+\n+Tier 2 and tier 1 targets place work on `liboqs` core project developers as a whole, to avoid breaking the target. The broader `liboqs` community may also feel more inclined to support higher-tier targets in their work. Thus, these tiers require commensurate and ongoing efforts from the maintainers of the target, to demonstrate value and to minimize any disruptions to ongoing `liboqs` development.\n+\n+This policy defines the requirements for accepting a proposed target at a given level of support.\n+\n+Each tier builds on all the requirements from the previous tier, unless overridden by a stronger requirement.\n+\n+Change of tier is subject to approval by the `liboqs` technical governance team.  This team is responsible for reviewing and evaluating the target, based on these requirements and their own judgment. The tea may apply additional requirements, including subjective requirements, such as to deal with issues not foreseen by this policy. (Such requirements may subsequently motivate additions to this policy.)\n+\n+While these criteria attempt to document the policy, that policy still involves human judgment. Targets must fulfill the spirit of the requirements as well, as determined by the judgment of the approving team. Reviewers and team members evaluating targets and target-specific patches should always use their own best judgment regarding the quality of work, and the suitability of a target for the `liboqs` project. Neither this policy nor any decisions made regarding targets shall create any binding agreement or estoppel by any party.\n+\n+Before filing an issue or pull request (PR) to introduce or promote a target, the target should already meet the corresponding tier requirements. This does not preclude an existing target's maintainers using issues (on the `liboqs` repository or otherwise) to track requirements that have not yet been met, as appropriate; however, before officially proposing the introduction or promotion of a target, it should meet all of the necessary requirements. A target proposal must quote the corresponding requirements verbatim and respond to them as part of explaining how the target meets those requirements. (For the requirements that simply state that the target or the target developers must not do something, it suffices to acknowledge the requirement.)\n+\n+Several parts of this policy require providing target-specific documentation. Such documentation should typically appear in a subdirectory of the platform-support section of the `liboqs` manual, with a link from the target's entry in platform support.\n+\n+Note that a target must have already received approval for the next lower tier, and spent a reasonable amount of time at that tier, before making a proposal for promotion to the next higher tier; this is true even if a target meets the requirements for several tiers at once. This policy leaves the precise interpretation of \"reasonable amount of time\" up to the approving team; the team may scale the amount of time required based on their confidence in the target and its demonstrated track record at its current tier. At a minimum, multiple stable releases of `liboqs` should typically occur between promotions of a target.\n+\n+The availability or tier of a target in stable `liboqs` is not a hard stability guarantee about the future availability or tier of that target. Higher-level target tiers are an increasing commitment to the support of a target, and we will take that commitment and potential disruptions into account when evaluating the potential demotion or removal of a target that has been part of a stable release. The promotion or demotion of a target will not generally affect existing stable releases, only current development and future releases.\n+\n+In this policy, the words \"must\" and \"must not\" specify absolute requirements that a target must meet to qualify for a tier. The words \"should\" and \"should not\" specify requirements that apply in almost all cases, but for which the approving teams may grant an exception for good reason. The word \"may\" indicates something entirely optional, and does not indicate guidance or recommendations. This language is based on [IETF RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).\n+\n+## Platforms supported\n+\n+### Tier 1\n+\n+- x86_64/amd64/x64 for Ubuntu Linux (Focal) and MacOS (XCode 14)\n+- aarch64 for Ubuntu (Focal)\n+- armhf/ARM7 and aarch64 emulation on Ubuntu\n+- ppc64le for Ubuntu (Focal)","path":"PLATFORMS.md","commit_id":"c47dbacb7c012598816fbc705e28348839725b1f","original_commit_id":"c47dbacb7c012598816fbc705e28348839725b1f","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"> _Very_ interesting.

All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder). In that directory, there is a custom `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate the existing CMake infrastructure into Zephyr. Furthermore, a Kconfig file is provided to configure the build (and especially the algorithm selection).

All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder). In that directory, there is a custom `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate the existing CMake infrastructure into Zephyr. Furthermore, a Kconfig file is provided to configure the build (and especially the algorithm selection). Finally, the new `OQS_randombytes_external` method is implemented in a small C source file here. \r\n\r\nAs this is my first PR for this project, I'm not sure if the changes are upstreamable in the current form. But I'm looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nKind

All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder).

everybody,\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the [Zephyr RTOS](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr), so liboqs can be used as a module (see [here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/modules.html)). \r\n\r\nThe main changes to the existing library code are focussed on the CMake build environment to enable the library to be built with the Zephyr SDK. All changes should not influence existing builds outside the Zephyr environment. (However, some changes also improve the integration of liboqs directly in a CMake-based project without installing it system-wide.) \r\n\r\nOne bigger source code change is related to random number generation. Zephyr doesn't support any of the currently present RNG interfaces. To be most flexible, I added a generic `OQS_USE_EXTERNAL_RNG` option (disabled by default). In this case, an externally defined method `OQS_randombytes_external()` must be present during link time, which is then used to obtain random data. For Zephyr, I implemented that method to generate random data using their RNG interface. \r\n\r\nThe main Zephyr integration is all contained in the new `zephyr` folder in the root directory (common practice for Zephyr modules to have this folder). In that directory, there is a custom `CMakeLists.txt` to integrate the existing CMake infrastructure into Zephyr. Furthermore, a Kconfig file is provided to configure the build (and especially the algorithm selection). Finally, the new `OQS_randombytes_external` method is implemented in a small C source file here. \r\n\r\nAs this is my first PR for this project, I'm not sure if the changes are upstreamable in the current form. But I'm looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nKind
