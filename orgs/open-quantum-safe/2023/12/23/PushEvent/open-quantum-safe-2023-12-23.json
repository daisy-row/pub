OpenSSL v3.2 was released last week and the circleci jobs for\r\nmacOS started failing since `openssl@3.1` is no longer available to install using homebrew. Instead the following\r\nare the options: `openssl@3` (which points to the current stable version, v3.2), `openssl@3.0` and `openssl@1.1`.\r\n\r\nChanges made in this PR include:\r\n- pointing the openssl version back to `openssl@3` since it now points to the latest 3.2\r\n- a small doc change to the CONTRIBUTING doc to update the circleci command to run a specific job locally.
