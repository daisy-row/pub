They are summarized below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/sampling_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nThis appears to be triggered by the array access `pos_qw[j]`. After reviewing the function's code, I believe this to be a false positive and have documented it as a \"pass\". There's an existing pass for the AVX2 version of this function.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/decode_portable.c#L40\r\n\r\nThe issue here seems to be the \"<\" operator. I changed this to `!(bits >> 6)` and it now passes (on my machine).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L45\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L50\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L51\r\n\r\nThese array accesses depend on the value of `a0`, which is one of the function arguments. Hence, I believe this to be secret-dependent behaviour. I added short loops to perform the array access in a secret-independent fashion, as is done [in HQC](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/hqc/pqclean_hqc-128_clean/gf2x.c#L49).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, the constant-time tests pass for all variants of BIKE on my machine.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\nFixes #1624.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and
