Adding something to such public API should be carefully considered.

They are summarized below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/sampling_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nThis appears to be triggered by the array access `pos_qw[j]`. After reviewing the function's code, I believe this to be a false positive and have documented it as a \"pass\". There's an existing pass for the AVX2 version of this function.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/decode_portable.c#L40\r\n\r\nThe issue here seems to be the \"<\" operator. I changed this to `!(bits >> 6)` and it now passes (on my machine).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L44\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L45\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L50\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/bike/additional_r4/gf2x_mul_base_portable.c#L51\r\n\r\nThese array accesses depend on the value of `a0`, which is one of the function arguments. Hence, I believe this to be (possible) secret-dependent behaviour. I added short loops to perform the array access in a secret-independent fashion, as is done [in HQC](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/hqc/pqclean_hqc-128_clean/gf2x.c#L49).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, the constant-time tests pass for all variants of BIKE on my machine.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
