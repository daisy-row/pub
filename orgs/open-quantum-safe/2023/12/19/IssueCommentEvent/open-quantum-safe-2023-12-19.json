All CT logic is visible in [this CI test](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/.github/workflows/weekly.yml): In essence, you need a Linux image with `valgrind` installed (we have prepared \"openquantumsafe/ci-ubuntu-focal-x86_64:latest\" for this), build `liboqs` with the required instrumentation for the platform of choice (e.g., `cmake` args -DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF -DOQS_OPT_TARGET=generic -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOQS_ENABLE_TEST_CONSTANT_TIME=ON) and execute the [test script](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/tests/test_constant_time.py). At its beginning a full explanation is contained in comments.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1862356520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-19T08:53:13Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

My \"quick fix\" of using a bitshift to check the `bits < 64` condition satisfied the Valgrind-powered constant-time tests but caused the Clang static analyzer to fail (see [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/3078/workflows/0c99ebaf-628d-4c11-9fd3-da4de27f53fc/jobs/24608?invite=true#step-103-1624_132)). Presumably, the static analyzer doesn't recognize that `!(bits >> 6)` and `bits < 64` are equivalent and is reporting an error because the assert statement may fail. I'm not sure how to resolve this in a way that will satisfy both the static analyzer and the constant-time tests. I'm also not certain that the \"<\" operator was causing the test failure in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf somebody more familiar with the inner workings of BIKE could take a look and offer input on\r\n1. whether or not this constitutes secret-dependent behaviour\r\n2. if yes, how to resolve it in a way that keeps the static analyzer happy.\r\n\r\nFeedback on the other constant-time errors (and my proposed fixes) would also be very welcome!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1863299627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-19T18:42:52Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Hence, I believe this to be (possible) secret-dependent behaviour. I added short loops to perform the array access in a secret-independent fashion, as is done [in HQC](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/8449e546491e77b52ca5b2f1451086ef564e16aa/src/kem/hqc/pqclean_hqc-128_clean/gf2x.c#L49).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, the constant-time tests pass for all variants of BIKE on my machine.\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
