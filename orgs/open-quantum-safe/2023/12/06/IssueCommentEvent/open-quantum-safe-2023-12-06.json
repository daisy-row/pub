They should know what they do and deal with ensuing problems themselves if they activate e.g., a generic \"OQS_EMBEDDED_API\" option (maybe some good documentation for that option would be helpful :). We also could issue a `cmake` warning at build time if such generic embedded system config as proposed in #1490 gets activated, e.g., \"no default RNG available. Be sure to call `OQS_randombytes_custom_algorithm`\".

A bit disappointing, I'd say. But what I did find is an option that demands approval by code owners. And _that_ can be set to specific directories, right? So what about the idea to carefully define code ownership(s), set this flag and revert back to just 1 review needed for PRs? Not ideal if there's a sole code owner designated for some sections and that person isn't around -- in such case the 4 eyes rule would be better again...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1843277795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-06T16:48:48Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
