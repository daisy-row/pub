This change was made as\r\npart of the following [PR](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commit/080c3dd2703a6b26f0aca12b265346a15f87c43e),\r\nwhere previously `openssl@3` pointed to `openssl v3.0.x` which was causing errors trying to build oqs-provider.\r\nSo the change was made to specify `openssl@3.1`. OpenSSL v3.2 was released last week and the circleci jobs for\r\nmacOS started failing since `openssl@3.1` is no longer available to install using homebrew. Instead the following\r\nare the options: `openssl@3` (which points to the current stable version, v3.2), `openssl@3.0` and `openssl@1.1`.\r\n\r\nChanges made in this PR include:\r\n- pointing the openssl version back to `openssl@3` since it now points to the latest 3.2\r\n- a small doc change to the CONTRIBUTING doc to update the circleci command to run a specific job locally. (In the latest\r\n  version (currently vv0.1.29314), this command does not have the --job flag)","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/commits/ced75e42afe966b846f196865f822222ff2674d9"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-12-05T11:00:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
