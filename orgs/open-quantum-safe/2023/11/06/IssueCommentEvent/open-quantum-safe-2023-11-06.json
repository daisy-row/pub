I'm leaning towards 2 but I don't know the changes that this would necessitate and how this would impact maintainability.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't really be testing against its own output. It would be testing against the output of the Falcon reference code when run with a slightly modified KAT program. The only changes to the KAT program would be\r\n1. working with a 1280-byte buffer and\r\n2. putting the `sign` function inside a loop so that it retries when necessary.\r\n\r\n> This is a pretty unusual API: The less memory a user passes, the longer the computation will take...\r\n> \r\n> In most cases (i.e., users not knowing about this and trusting the reported sig size) this is a waste of CPU cycles, particularly if done in and triggered&supported by a library more widely used. No solution aiming for a good ecological impact should permit users to inadvertently cause wasteful computations.\r\n> \r\n> Hence my preference clearly is on option 3: Set the value such that the algorithm always performs the minimum amount of computation.\r\n\r\nI don't think that setting the buffer to 1330 bytes would accomplish this: that value just happens to be chosen such that the algorithm never retries for the 100 NIST KATs, which use the same \"randomness\" each time. I believe we would have to use the \"compressed\" format to ensure that there are no retries.\r\n\r\n> I think OQS uses \"Compressed format\", as that's the only format that has variable size signatures. I would like to suggest OQS uses \"Padded format\".\r\n\r\nOQS (via PQClean) currently does use the \"padded\" format. That's why\r\n\r\n> the signature generator retries if the obtained compressed signature does not fit. \r\n\r\nI guess that a more precise summary of the issue, using terminology from the Falcon documentation, would be this:\r\n- the Falcon KATs are generated using the \"compressed\" format. The theoretical maximum buffer size is 1462 bytes, but since the program is deterministic, we know that 1330 bytes will suffice.\r\n- OQS (via PQClean) uses the \"padded\" format, which occasionally (in this case, one in a hundred times) results in a different signature due to the upper bound on size.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, I'd like to amend my posited \"option 3\":\r\n3. Use the \"compressed\" signature format, which entails a 1462-byte maximum buffer for Falcon-1024.\r\n\r\nI personally like the idea of supporting both \"compressed\" and \"padded\" (and possibly \"constant time\") formats. However, this would still require us to modify the reference KAT generation program to produce KATs for the \"padded\" version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1795209859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-06T15:59:12Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`.

#1560:\r\n\r\n> our implementation of Falcon-1024 differs from the upstream on a single KAT, number 82. I put together a demonstration here: https://github.com/SWilson4/falcon-diff\r\n\r\n> This seems to be explained by the signature buffer size used for the KATs: our implementation uses the signature size of 1280 bytes while the upstream code passes a larger buffer of 1330 bytes (even though the signature size upstream is still defined to be 1280 bytes). I'm not sure yet why this is done, but redefining the signature size to be 1330 in liboqs does make all 100 KATs pass.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1796571835","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1561#issuecomment-1796571835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1561","id":1796571835,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5rFYK7","user":{"login":"kriskwiatkowski","id":1159844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk4NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1159844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski","html_url":"https://github.com/kriskwiatkowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriskwiatkowski/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-06T21:42:31Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T21:42:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"One thing to note - in falcon spec, point 3.11.3 says \"Partial padding is not valid: if the signature has padding bytes, then all padding bytes must be zero, and the total padded length must be equal to sbytelen\".\r\nSo, if it's padded version, then it must be equal to ``sbytelen``.
