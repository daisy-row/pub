Are the current (all 100) Falcon KATs to be treated as the goal to match (by an improved implementation) or as another element to be updated? The latter surely if we'd anyway consider having different Falcon flavours supported. In any case [the documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/docs/algorithms/sig/falcon.md) ought to be updated (as to what Falcon variant `liboqs` actually implements).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1797927381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-07T07:05:40Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

The test will pass because **signature_len** is an output computed internally by the sign() function specifying the length of the generated signature returned and the same length signature is verified by the verify() function.  **signature_len** is given as input to verify().\r\n\r\nsign() and verify() should be updated to fixed length signatures.\r\n\r\nrc = OQS_SIG_sign(sig, _signature_, **&signature_len**, message, message_len, secret_key);\r\n\r\nrc = OQS_SIG_verify(sig, message, message_len, _signature_, **signature_len**, public_key);\r\n\r\nfor [pqclean_falcon-512_clean](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean), internally that would be: \r\n**PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_comp_encode()**\r\nin https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/codec.c\r\n\r\ncalled by:\r\nstatic int do_sign(uint8_t *nonce, uint8_t *sigbuf, size_t *sigbuflen, const uint8_t *m, size_t mlen, const uint8_t *sk) ()\r\nin https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c\r\nwhich is called by:\r\nPQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_crypto_sign_signature() \r\nin https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.
