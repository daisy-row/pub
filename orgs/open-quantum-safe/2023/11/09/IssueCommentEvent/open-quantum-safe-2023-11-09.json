For now, it seems like the simplest fix is to support the \"padded\" version (which is also the version that PQClean intended to implement). I'm going to get to work on a PR for PQClean. When it's merged we can pull it in here via `copy_from_upstream`.\r\n\r\nLooking further ahead, it would be nice to support both formats, and possibly the \"constant time\" format as well. I've made issues here (#1608) and in PQClean (PQClean/PQClean#523) to track both the short-term fix and progress toward this longer-term goal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1804695776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-09T21:15:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
