Currently, we intend to support the \"padded\" format, which has fixed-length signatures. (As of writing, we don't actually do that and neither does PQClean: see #1561 and https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/523.) It would be nice to support both \"compressed\" and \"padded\" formats in liboqs, and possibly the \"constant time\" format as well.\r\n\r\nMore detail on formatting from the [Falcon reference implementation](https://falcon-sign.info/impl/falcon.h.html):\r\n\r\n>  127  * There are three formats for signatures:\r\n  128  *\r\n  129  *   - COMPRESSED: this is the default format, which yields the shortest\r\n  130  *     signatures on average. However, the size is variable (see below)\r\n  131  *     though within a limited range.\r\n  132  *\r\n  133  *   - PADDED: this is the compressed format, but with extra padding bytes\r\n  134  *     to obtain a fixed size known at compile-time. The size depends only\r\n  135  *     on the degree; the FALCON_SIG_PADDED_SIZE macro computes it. The\r\n  136  *     signature process enforces that size by restarting the process\r\n  137  *     until an appropriate size is obtained (such restarts are uncommon\r\n  138  *     enough that the computational overhead is negligible).\r\n  139  *\r\n  140  *   - CT: this is a fixed-size format, which furthermore allows\r\n  141  *     constant-time processing with regard to the signature value and\r\n  142  *     message data. This is meant for uncommon situations in which\r\n  143  *     the signed data is secret but of low entropy, and the public key\r\n  144  *     is not actually public. The CT format is larger than the\r\n  145  *     COMPRESSED and PADDED formats.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1608/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-09T21:08:44Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
