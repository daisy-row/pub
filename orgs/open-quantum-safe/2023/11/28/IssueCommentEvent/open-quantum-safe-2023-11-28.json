I just fixed the asan Security Check test failure so that check should pass now. What do you think I should add? Should I do more sigalgs other than dilithium? Also I tried to change the YAML such that the hash-n-sign sigalgs would just be mixed with but I wasn't exactly sure how that should have been formatted.
