If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`.

The following config options are irrelevant: `OQS_DIST_BUILD`, `OQS_USE_OPENSSL`; I even compiled using gcc-12 instead of clang-14: To no avail, if `liboqs` is built shared, the KEM KAT tests fail reliably on that x64 machine. I compared the exact same config on my own x64 machine (not MacOS, but also clang-14 and all CPU extensions reported identically) and all KATs are correct there. I then had the hunch that the shared lib concept of MacOS may play in this here and tested on the M1: And indeed the same config also fails there -- different architecture, different compiler, same shared library concept (MacOS). I still don't understand what's happening here.... Any MacOS experts around? (@dstebila ?)\r\n\r\nI think I know what's happening, but I don't know why it would be caused by this particular config... if you look at the failed results, the computed KAT hashes are different at each run. This leads me to believe that either\r\n1. the system RNG is being used instead of one of the deterministic PRNGs or\r\n2. the deterministic PRNGs are being used but not seeded properly.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, a deterministic PRNG were used with an uninitialized buffer it might explain the apparent randomness. However, the former possibility seems more likely to me. From the point of view of the non-HQC KATs, the only thing that's changed (other than being wrapped in an `if`/`else` block) is the build configuration for `kat_kem`: see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1585/files#r1381665498.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1792422996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-03T13:18:13Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
