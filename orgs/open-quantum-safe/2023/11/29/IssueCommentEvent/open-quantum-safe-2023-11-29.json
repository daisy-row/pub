But our build instructions should work on windows. @baentsch @SWilson4 @praveksharma, do we have a windows machine that we can use to attempt to reproduce this? Seems odd that our build instructions don't work on windows.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1832414338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-29T17:46:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

Why no use of `cmake -GNinja ..` within a build directory? Why referencing `src`? This is not where the main `cmake` files reside. Then: Is `liboqs/src` _really_ at this path? It doesn't make any sense to copy the github repo to \"Program Files (x86)\". Then, is this really `x64` or truly `x86`? The former works, the latter doesn't.\r\nWe have a [Bug Report template](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) that would provide much more information.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1832531081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-29T19:07:00Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
