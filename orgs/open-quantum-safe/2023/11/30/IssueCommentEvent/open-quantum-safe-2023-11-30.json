OpenSSL v3.2 was released last week and the circleci jobs for macOS started failing since `openssl@3.1` is no longer available to install using homebrew. Instead the following are the options: `openssl@3` (which points to the current stable version, v3.2), `openssl@3.0` and `openssl@1.1`.\r\n\r\nChanges made in this PR include:\r\n- pointing the openssl version back to `openssl@3` since it now points to the latest 3.2\r\n- a small doc change to the CONTRIBUTING doc to update the circleci command to run a specific job locally. (This command no longer accepts the --job option)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1834316009","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/305#issuecomment-1834316009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/305","id":1834316009,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l85tVXDp","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-30T18:21:05Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T18:21:05Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> (fyi @SWilson4 @dstebila to help implement the things we write in `liboqs` PR: Pretty much at the time of merging such algorithm changes we ought to have downstream PRs available).\r\n\r\nNoted, will do in the future.
