Id advise sticking anything in c:\\Program Files (x86) directories with that space in it and liboqs-cpp shows you how to not specify that directory if you so choose.  Thanks for all your cool work. jim","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1824721290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-11-23T16:50:57Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
