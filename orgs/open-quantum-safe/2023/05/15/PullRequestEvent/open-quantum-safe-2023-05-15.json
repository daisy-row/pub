Does this PR require to include these other implementations before it can be merged?\r\n\r\nThere were some not quite obvious quirks before the contents of the McEliece update in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/469 could be integrated to `liboqs`: Please see the changes particularly in `docs/algorithms/kem/classic_mceliece.yml`, `scripts/copy_from_upstream/copy_from_upstream.py`, `scripts/copy_from_upstream/copy_from_upstream.yml` and the addition of `src/common/pqclean_shims/crypto_declassify.h`.\r\n\r\nParticularly on the latter file, asking @dstebila as to whether we really need this -- and whether the addition of the SPDX line is appropriate (wasn't there): Shall this be done upstream before https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/469 is merged?\r\n\r\nFinal question: This inadvertently also changes Falcon -- and there, the KATs. Why is this so? Is the McEliece branch in PQClean older than https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/476 ? One more reason to not merge this. But at least CI will show us which impact merging https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/469 would have on `liboqs`.\r\n\r\n* [Yes] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [No] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API?

Original XMSS has signature format: `(sm || m)` (signature concat with message). This PR seperates `sm` and `m`\r\n2. Original XMSS has hash calls like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n                     unsigned char *out,\r\n                     const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    unsigned char buf[32];\r\n\r\n    if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(buf, in, inlen);\r\n        memcpy(out, buf, 24);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 24, in, inlen);\r\n    }   \r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE128) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake128(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha512(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 64, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR optimizes hash call via define macro at compile time. The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Share code: This PR has structure following FrodoKEM, share code between parameters. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider), [OQS-OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl), [OQS-BoringSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl), and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is
