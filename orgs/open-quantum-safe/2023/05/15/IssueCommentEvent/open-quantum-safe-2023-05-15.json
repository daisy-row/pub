And between #1460 and #1420, that would accomplish everything on your list except for the algorithm name changes.  So maybe it would save work to follow Michael's plan of merging #1460 into #1420 and then #1420 into main?  The only question would then be whether we do the SPHINCS+ name changes before merging #1420 into main or afterwards.  In the interests of keeping the commits smaller (already #1460+1420 will be pretty big) I'd say we do the name changes after merging 1420.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1548141334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-15T16:04:04Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
