Is (possibly not correctly) supporting compilers this old really an issue, though? General question: Does `liboqs` really want to support compilers this old or rather add documentation and compiler version checks (for a certain minimum version) to minimize our efforts on outdated software? We also check for minimum `cmake` version, for example...
