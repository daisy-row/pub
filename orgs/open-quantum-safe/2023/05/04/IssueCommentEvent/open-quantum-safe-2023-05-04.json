Trying to do anything with the key is then dicey: in testing, I've had `oqs_sig_verify' bail because the slot was null, but I've also seen junk data used as a public key; for some reason, I've not seen a segfault, but it seems distinctly possible.\r\n\r\nI did a superficial survey of the other places in the code where `privkey' and `pubkey' get set: `oqsx_key_fromdata' is the only function which does it by hand; `oqsx_key_op' and `oqsx_key_gen' are the only callers of `oqsx_allocate_keymaterial', even though it's an external function.\r\n\r\nIt seems common to leave the `privkey' and `pubkey' buffers allocated in the event of a subsequent failure, so I just returned the failure indicator, assuming that `oqsx_key_set_composites' would have already noted the problem with OpenSSL; but in fact, `oqsx_key_set_composites' is secretly infallible anyway, so the question doesn't arise in practice.\r\n\r\nFixes #148\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1535517288","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/149#issuecomment-1535517288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/149","id":1535517288,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l85bhiJo","user":{"login":"distorted-mdw","id":10420519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDIwNTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10420519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw","html_url":"https://github.com/distorted-mdw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/distorted-mdw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-04T23:14:16Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T23:14:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":" Yes, they would need to have the same algorithms.\r\n\r\nAlso, I failed to experiment, because too much other stuff going on.
