You can set the randomness to use `OQS_RAND_alg_nist_kat`, and derive all the randomness used from a seed, but this is a somewhat imperfect solution for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- The seed must be exactly 48 bytes\r\n- It references a global variable, resulting in concurrency issues\r\n- Modifying the randomness used is (to my knowledge) not available with any of the liboqs language wrappers\r\n\r\nI'm curious if others think this is a functionality worth adding and if so, what the proper way to tackle it might be. Some schemes, like Kyber, are already constructed in such a way that everything is derived from a seed, but liboqs provides limited ability to set that seed. I suspect the situation for other schemes is much more complex.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1553363657","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206#issuecomment-1553363657","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206","id":1553363657,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5clnLJ","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-18T17:11:11Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T17:11:11Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI @tedeaton I was talking to Peter Schwabe @cryptojedi who says there are some efforts underway to add a deterministic API to some of the Kyber implementations he works on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1553363657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T17:11:12Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

As an example use case, [Messaging Layer Security](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/mls-protocol/draft-ietf-mls-protocol.html) makes extensive use of functionality to share multiple keypairs by communicating seeds. I think it would be nice to match RFC9180 and add a functionality to deterministically derive a keypair from a seed.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of possible in liboqs currently. You can set the randomness to use `OQS_RAND_alg_nist_kat`, and derive all the randomness used from a seed, but this is a somewhat imperfect solution for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- The seed must be exactly 48 bytes\r\n- It references a global variable, resulting in concurrency issues\r\n- Modifying the randomness used is (to my knowledge) not available with any of the liboqs language wrappers\r\n\r\nI'm curious if others think this is a functionality worth adding and if so, what the proper way to tackle it might be. Some schemes, like Kyber, are already constructed in such a way that everything is derived from a seed, but liboqs provides limited ability to set that seed. I suspect the situation for other schemes is much more complex.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1553423125","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206#issuecomment-1553423125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1206","id":1553423125,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5cl1sV","user":{"login":"cryptojedi","id":3762820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjI4MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3762820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi","html_url":"https://github.com/cryptojedi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptojedi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-18T18:01:50Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T18:01:50Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You can take a look at https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/blob/standard/ref/kem.c and https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/blob/standard/ref/kem.h to see what I did.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1553423125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-05-18T18:01:51Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
