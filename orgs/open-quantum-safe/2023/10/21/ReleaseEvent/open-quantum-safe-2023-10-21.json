oqs-provider 0.5.2\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nThe **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**oqs-provider** is a standalone [OpenSSL 3](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) [provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)-based quantum-safe and [hybrid key exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology) for TLS 1.3, as well as quantum-safe and hybrid X.509 certificate generation, CMS, CMP and `dgst` (signature) operations.\r\n\r\nWhen deployed, the `oqs-provider` binary (shared library) thus adds support for quantum-safe cryptographic operations to any standard OpenSSL(v3) installation. The ultimate goal is that all `openssl` functionality shall be [PQC-enabled](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography).\r\n\r\nIn general, the oqs-provider `main` branch is meant to be usable in conjunction with the `main` branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) and the `master` branch of [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl).\r\n\r\nFurther details on building, testing and use can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/README.md). See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.5.2 of oqs-provider.\r\n\r\n### Security considerations\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### What's New\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.5.1 release of oqs-provider and is fully tested to be used in conjunction with the main branch of [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs). This release is guaranteed to be in sync with v0.9.0 of `liboqs`.\r\n\r\nThis release also makes available ready-to-run binaries for Windows (.dll) and MacOS (.dylib) compiled for `x64` CPUs. Activation and use is documented in [USAGE.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/USAGE.md).\r\n\r\n### Additional new feature highlights\r\n\r\n- Algorithm updates as documented in the [liboqs 0.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.9.0)\r\n- [Standard coding style](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#coding-style)\r\n- Enhanced memory leak protection\r\n- [Added community cooperation documentation](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- (optional) [KEM algorithm en-/decoder feature](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/CONFIGURE.md#oqs_kem_encoders)\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* switch repo to -dev mode/unlock release by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/225\r\n* add C API and cleanup PQ terminology [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/226\r\n* Clarify install instructions by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/232\r\n* sigalg config warning by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/235\r\n* Fix a missing `-DOQS_PROVIDER_BUILD_STATIC=ON` in CircleCI build static jobs. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/242\r\n* Fix DOQS_ALGS_ENABLED setting for cmake by @marcbrevoort-cyberhive in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/238\r\n* Fix #224: Add a clang-format that matches the best the OpenSSL coding style. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/241\r\n* corner case object creation added by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/243\r\n* fix for runtests.sh: skip non-working OpenSSL versions by @bhess in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/244\r\n* Add a GithubCI job to test oqs-provider against memory leaks. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/246\r\n* Fix various memory leaks. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/245\r\n* remove unneeded OQS context reference from CCI PRs by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/250\r\n* Cross-compile to linux-aarch64 from linux-x64 in GitHub actions. by @thb-sb in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/253\r\n* add manual approval step to use restricted CCI context by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/254\r\n* Create SECURITY.md by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/257\r\n* Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/258\r\n* adding contributing guideline [skip ci] by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/259\r\n* CI & cmake changes by @qnfm in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/263\r\n* fix for txt output length of plain PQ key material by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/268\r\n* KEM en/decoders by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/266\r\n* Remove duplicate LIBOQS_BRANCH option in CONFIGURE.md by @psschwei in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/274\r\n* add cloudflare interop tests by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/278\r\n* Add releasetest by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/281\r\n* Support web proxy in external interop tests by @mouse07410 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/288\r\n* Get Windows CI to work again;
