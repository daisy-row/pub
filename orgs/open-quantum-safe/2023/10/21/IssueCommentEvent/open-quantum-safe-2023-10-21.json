This codepoint can live forever until we get the final final spec. At that point we will not need the codepoint any more, but it can still be supported until everyone migrates. This is the approach TLS is taking as well. \r\n\r\nWe would like to have OQS OpenSSH support this codepoint as the defacto PQ OpenSSH library. Otherwise there is no reason to support it on our own. \r\n\r\nAny interest in adding support for a \"temporary permanent\" P256+Kyber768 codepoint?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1773730818","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145#issuecomment-1773730818","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145","id":1773730818,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV85puPwC","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-21T09:29:43Z","updated_at":"2023-10-21T09:29:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> OpenSSH indicated that they would like to support x25519-mlkem768-sha256 if they find time to implement.\r\n\r\nMay I ask then which value is still seen in retaining this fork?
