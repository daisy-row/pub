Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

I have no objection to doing that. In adding them to the API I was just following the same pattern as we use for the NIST KAT DRBG. Although that is presumably of much wider interest than the HQC version. The only use case that I can think of for someone else needing to have the HQC PRNG interface exposed is to run all 100 KATs, since our test currently only checks the first. And we'll (hopefully) be fixing that soon.\r\n\r\nThe HQC code is \"public domain\" so presumably the SPDX identifier for `kat_kem.c` (currently MIT) would need to be updated?","created_at":"2023-10-30T17:53:14Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T17:53:14Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1585#discussion_r1376610681","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1585","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1376610681"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1585#discussion_r1376610681"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1585"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/comments/1376610681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":79,"original_line":79,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1376476243,"original_position":21,"position":21,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pulls/1585","id":1564978739,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA-eq3c5dR64z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1585","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1585.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1585.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1585","number":1585,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Pull new HQC implementation from upstream","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\nRun copy_from_upstream to pull the [recently merged](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512) HQC updates from PQClean. Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
