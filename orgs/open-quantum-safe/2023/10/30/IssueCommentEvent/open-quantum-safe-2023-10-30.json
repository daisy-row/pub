It adds a new compile flag, \"OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR\", which exposes deterministic key derivation. This is intended to be used with RFC 9180 for hybrid public key encryption, which defines KEMs to have a \"DeriveKeyPair\" algorithm (in addition to key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\nAdds functionality requested in #1206 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider), [OQS-OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl), [OQS-BoringSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl), and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\nThis adds a \"derive_keypair\" to the KEM API when the compile flag OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR is enabled.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nI tried to have it so that if the OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR is not defined, then no changes happen to liboqs. This results in some code replication.
