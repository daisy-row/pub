Maintainer: Person with github administrative rights.\n+\n+2. Committer: Person with github \"Write\" privileges; this entails the right and obligation to review PRs by Contributors and to actively participate in discussions.\n+\n+3. Contributor: Person that has contributed code.\n+\n+4. Users: Person using the project passively or actively, e.g., by participating in discussions.\n+\n+## Relationships between roles\n+\n+Any User may also be Contributor. Any Contributor may also be Committer. Any Committer may also be Maintainer. A Maintainer must be a Committer.\n+\n+## Change of role\n+\n+Any User may become Contributor by creating a pull request (PR) and getting it successfully reviewed and merged by Committers.\n+\n+Any Contributor can become Committer by contributing sufficient code and displaying deep subject matter knowledge in discussions such that a majority of Committers vote for this change of role. A Maintainer can veto such vote. Such veto can be overruled by a 2/3 majority of Committers.\n+\n+As such voting decision may be considered subjective, Contributors striving to become Committers are encouraged to ask for advice by Committers as to what --if anything-- should be done (additionally to already documented knowledge in contributions) to attain this status. Baseline requirements for contributions are documented in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Any Contributor can create a discussion item to request a vote to become Committer.\n+\n+Any Committer can become Maintainer by majority vote of voting Committers. A current Maintainer can veto such vote. Such veto can be overruled by a 2/3 majority of all Committers.\n+\n+A Maintainer is not permitted to remove another Maintainer's github privileges.\n+\n+A Committer automatically may be moved to Contributor status if not actively contributing by discussion or PR review during the last 90 days or if voluntarily suspending this status (leave of absence etc.). If a Maintainer loses the Committer status and with this, the Maintainer status (or voluntarily steps down from this role) the Committers have to determine whether a new Maintainer needs to be elected.\n+\n+Any person violating the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), consistently not fulfilling the role responsibilities or other reasons can lose the role held if a simple majority of Committers votes for such removal and no Maintainer vetos that decision. If a Maintainer is to be removed from that role a 2/3 majority of Committers must agree.\n+\n+Depending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus status. Emeritus Maintainers may still be consulted on some project matters, and can be returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes and a simple majority of Committers agrees.\n+\n+## Voting\n+\n+Change of role or changes to this document is subject to voting.\n+\n+Votes are to be executed by way of open github discussions. No quorum is needed for votes open for 4 weeks. Urgent matters may be decided by majority vote among Maintainers or 2/3 majority by all Committers within an arbitrary voting period.\n+\n+Any Committer may voluntarily temporarily for a documented period step down from the role losing voting rights for the specified period. If such period extends beyond one year, the Committer permanently loses role and rights. The period is documented in this file next to the person's name below.","path":"GOVERNANCE.md","commit_id":"eee85a228501e55d8696f2744f498077c7b821fb","original_commit_id":"eee85a228501e55d8696f2744f498077c7b821fb","user":{"login":"SWilson4","id":39264796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjY0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39264796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4","html_url":"https://github.com/SWilson4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SWilson4/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"What is meant by \"permanently\" here?

XMSS changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelogs\r\n\r\n- Made code compatible with MSVC in order to merge into `main` branch: Remove variable length array in `XMSS/external/` by converting them to `malloc/calloc` and `OQS_insecure_free()`\r\n- Cleaned up unused files: `sign.c` and `sign.h`. \r\n- Fixed all segfaults. \r\n- Added `katfile` to test that takes too long to generate a key pair. \r\n- Removed a lot of LOC, so the code base of XMSS parameters are shorter, and easier to edit. \r\n- Changed in memory allocation: `sk->secret_key_data` is allocated by default. The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see it’s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

XMSS changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelogs\r\n\r\n- Made code compatible with MSVC in order to merge into `main` branch: Remove variable length array in `XMSS/external/` by converting them to `malloc/calloc` and `OQS_insecure_free()`\r\n- Cleaned up unused files: `sign.c` and `sign.h`. \r\n- Fixed all segfaults. \r\n- Added `katfile` to test that takes too long to generate a key pair. \r\n- Removed a lot of LOC, so the code base of XMSS parameters are shorter, and easier to edit. \r\n- Changed in memory allocation: `sk->secret_key_data` is allocated by default. The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see it’s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.
