I think of it not as a requirement but an environment fix: if you are running on a platform with threading, and if that threading model is `pthreads`, this PR provides a fix. Otherwise the code will not `#include <pthread.h>` because you're on something else like Win32 and you can submit a fix yourself, or you have no threading at all and there is nothing to fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1783017752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-10-27T14:30:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
