https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/273\r\n\r\n`liboqs_DIR` is a CMake cache entry to hint CMake about the location of liboqs\r\nCMake package.\r\n\r\nHowever, being able to use `LIBOQS_DIR` (full capitalized) would be more\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to use either `liboqs_DIR` as a cache entry, `liboqs_DIR`\r\nas an environment variable, `LIBOQS_DIR` as a cache entry and `LIBOQS_DIR`\r\nas an env variable.\r\n\r\nTests were also added to make sure that these variables are well taken\r\nby CMake during the configuration stage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1751485464","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/275#issuecomment-1751485464","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/275","id":1751485464,"node_id":"IC_kwDOE_A9l85oZYwY","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-06T23:03:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-06T23:03:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've
