The error list written up above is exactly visible as such by clicking at [any of the failing pre-merge CI runs, e.g., this](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/2930/workflows/044e6e1c-f3f2-46ea-87c2-39b33a3455c9/jobs/23437). Or does this statement \r\n\r\n> Some XMSS tests takes too long and hit the time-out limit.\r\n\r\nmake you consider CI results as not relevant/trustworthy for this code? Allow me to posit the goal that any code destined for \"main\" has \"full feature coverage\" CI that not only passes but does that also within the 1h. Extending this period makes contributions (of anything) \"unpleasant\" (_and_ is bad to the environment by way of too many CPU cycles/power/CO2 consumed).\r\n\r\n@ashman-p You once asked how to separate between \"productive\" and \"experimental\"/\"research\" code: I think this is one such area: Stuff that cannot be fully tested in a standard CI environment should stay in a separate \"experimental\" branch. IMO we could also further relax other CI tasks in such new branch (like style or memory checks).
