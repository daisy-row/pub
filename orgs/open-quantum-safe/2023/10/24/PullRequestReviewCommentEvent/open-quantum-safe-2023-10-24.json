The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

XMSS changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelogs\r\n\r\n- Made code compatible with MSVC in order to merge into `main` branch: Remove variable length array in `XMSS/external/` by converting them to `malloc/calloc` and `OQS_insecure_free()`\r\n- Cleaned up unused files: `sign.c` and `sign.h`. \r\n- Fixed all segfaults. \r\n- Added `katfile` to test that takes too long to generate a key pair. \r\n- Removed a lot of LOC, so the code base of XMSS parameters are shorter, and easier to edit. \r\n- Changed in memory allocation: `sk->secret_key_data` is allocated by default. The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members.

XMSS changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelogs\r\n\r\n- Made code compatible with MSVC in order to merge into `main` branch: Remove variable length array in `XMSS/external/` by converting them to `malloc/calloc` and `OQS_insecure_free()`\r\n- Cleaned up unused files: `sign.c` and `sign.h`. \r\n- Fixed all segfaults. \r\n- Added `katfile` to test that takes too long to generate a key pair. \r\n- Removed a lot of LOC, so the code base of XMSS parameters are shorter, and easier to edit. \r\n- Changed in memory allocation: `sk->secret_key_data` is allocated by default. The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and

Ignore Kyber and Dilithium updates as we don't yet want to move to the \"standard\" version.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately a bit of a \"kitchen sink\" PR: it contains\r\n1. a new version of HQC from https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/512,\r\n2. updates to Falcon and Sphincs+ which landed in PQClean before the HQC code was merged, and\r\n3. support for the HQC custom PRNG for KAT checking.\r\n\r\nNotably, this PR does _not_ contain the latest [Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/504) and [Dilithium](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) updates from PQClean, as this would entail updating liboqs to be in sync with the \"standard\" track. If/when this is merged, we will be out of sync with PQClean.\r\n\r\nWhen patching HQC, I made a number of minor changes to the upstream code, mostly to address undefined or implementation-defined behaviour and endianness issues. I also wrote a new modular reduction routine to address https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482; this can be found in `vector.c`. It might be easier to review my changes directly against the reference implementation; you can view the patches [here](https://github.com/SWilson4/package-pqclean/tree/main/hqc/patches).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\nFixes #1319.\r\nFixes #995.\r\n\r\n<!-- Any PR adding a new feature is expected to contain a test; the test should be part of CI testing, preferably within the \".github/workflows\" directory tree. Please add an explanation to the PR if/when (why) this cannot be done. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in fully supported downstream projects dependent on these, i.e., [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider) and

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

XMSS changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelogs\r\n\r\n- Made code compatible with MSVC in order to merge into `main` branch: Remove variable length array in `XMSS/external/` by converting them to `malloc/calloc` and `OQS_insecure_free()`\r\n- Cleaned up unused files: `sign.c` and `sign.h`. \r\n- Fixed all segfaults. \r\n- Added `katfile` to test that takes too long to generate a key pair. \r\n- Removed a lot of LOC, so the code base of XMSS parameters are shorter, and easier to edit. \r\n- Changed in memory allocation: `sk->secret_key_data` is allocated by default. The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.

The `OQS_SECRET_KEY_XMSS_deserialize_key` is simply copy memory, instead of allocation new memory and copy. I think this should also be applied to LMS as well. I see itâ€™s error-prone and inefficient to allocate memory each time the `deserialize` happens. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduce `is_locked` to `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure\r\n\r\nDuring my investigation of why the current code is hanging in the test, I realized we have overlap locks, the scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. User wants to sign\r\n2. XMSS locks the secret key in the sign operation. \r\n3. Sign operation invokes `serialize_key`, which locks the secret key again. \r\n4. Cause hangs. \r\n\r\nTo eliminate the double locks problem, I add `bool is_locked` into `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` structure. The default value at object initialization is `is_locked = false`. \r\n\r\nNow the `OQS_SIG_STFL_SECRET_KEY` object will have information about the lock status. \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThis code will work with either `OQS_USE_PTHREADS_IN_TESTS` on or off. I tested both cases.
