In testing, it's with the executable directly (where the executable linker may resolve the dependency automatically). As to why your explicit reference to \"Threads::Threads\" isn't honoured, I cannot comment on. [SO comments that `-lpthread` needs to be added](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59508259/in-depth-explanation-for-why-we-need-pthread-in-linker-option-for-gcc).\r\n\r\n> Besides, the cmake step should fail if pthreads is not found since the find_package is called with REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what I don't find very appealing: This will break builds of `liboqs` if \"pthreads\" is not available. Wouldn't it be better to not break (but behave as it does right now)? But then again, the current behaviour isn't right -- so if we need to add pthreads to make it operate correctly with threading, so be it.
