More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.9.0 of liboqs. It was released on October 12, 2023.\r\n\r\nThis release features an update to the Classic McEliece KEM, bringing it in line with NIST Round 4. It also adds or updates ARM implementations for Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.8.0 release of liboqs.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- Classic McEliece: updated to Round 4 version.\r\n- Kyber: aarch64 implementation updated.\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Dilithium: aarch64 implementation updated.\r\n- Falcon: aarch64 implementation added.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Update algorithm documentation\r\n- Support compilation for Windows on ARM64, Apple mobile, and Android platforms\r\n- Improve resilience of randombytes on Apple systems\r\n\r\nRelease call\r\n============\r\n\r\nUsers of liboqs are invited to join a webinar on Thursday, November 2, 2023, from 12-1pm US Eastern time for information on this release, plans for the next release cycle, and to provide feedback on OQS usage and features.  \r\n\r\nThe Zoom link for the webinar is:
