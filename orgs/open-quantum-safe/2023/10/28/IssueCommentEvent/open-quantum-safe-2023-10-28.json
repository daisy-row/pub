The update source is given by a git commit SHA for the upstream repo.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the option to override this on a scheme-by-scheme basis so that integrating upstream code doesn't get messy if OQS (deliberately) goes out of sync with an upstream source on some algorithms but not others. For instance, we could specify that the PQClean aarch64 implementations of Dilithium and Kyber should remain at the latest commit before [PQClean updated their implementation to be in sync with the pq-crystals `standard` branches](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/pull/511) while still pulling the latest updates to HQC and Sphincs+.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1584/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1783724349","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1584#issuecomment-1783724349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1584","id":1783724349,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5qUXk9","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-28T06:45:20Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T06:45:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"FYI, my plan is to introduce another upstream to `copy_from_upstream.yml` called \"oldpqclean\": That shall reference the last commit in which Kyber&Dilithium aarch64 were OK.
