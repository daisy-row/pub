As part of my review, I did run this code through \"test_constant_time.py\" to see whether it indeed is flawless as the PR implies by eliminating suppression entirely -- but it failed.

The latter is necessary to check the `valgrind` report and do a suitable suppression file - manually checking & documenting each and every `valgrind` finding for correctness.
