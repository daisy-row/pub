As we are working through this, we will all try to interop with the ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```. It is supported in OQS OpenSSH and wolfSSH, which is great. \r\n\r\nNow there is one concern about backwards compatibility. Someone that implements the method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` today may have interop issues in a couple of years when Kyber has been slightly tweaked or something in the method has been tweaked in the draft and the peer implements the latest version. That is a concern for any RFC draft which changes over time. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such problems we could introduce a temporary identifier that basically creates a snapshot of the method in time. For example, we could rename ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` to method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00```. That basically means the method is specific to the time it was implemented (Kyber-512 round 3 the way draft -00 explained the method). In the next change which breaks compatibility for that method, its name will change to something like ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-d01``` or something like that. So, old clients that were not upgraded would not be able to negotiate ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00``` any more and they would still interop using classical methods. When the RFC is ratified, the final standardized name would be ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```\r\n\r\nI know this is not something we have done for TLS 1.3 group names, or SSH methods. But have you given it any thought? Would it be too much overhead to rename the method every time something underlying (KEM algorithm, or implementation detail) changes?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1418428370","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134#issuecomment-1418428370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134","id":1418428370,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV85Ui3_S","user":{"login":"csosto-pk","id":24617764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE3NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24617764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk","html_url":"https://github.com/csosto-pk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-06T02:53:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T02:53:31Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Michael @baentsch ,\r\n\r\nThx for the feedback. \r\n\r\n> Bigger issue: Which entity defines \"the need\" for a name change -- and to which specific name? \r\n\r\nThe way I think it should work is that every time you are making a compatibility breaking change, that is where you change the identifier. For example, if you change the combiner (in SSH the draft has option 1, 2a, 2b and 2c), or if there is a new Kyber Round 4 version. One example for TLS 1.3 is when the IETF draft switched from using the length of the ```key_share``` before the key/ciphertext itself. A later version of the draft removed the length, and that would trigger a new ```group``` identifier to negotiate.\r\n\r\nThe IETF draft should be responsible for incrementing this value imo. I mean for TLS 1.3, right now OQS OpenSSL is the source of truth, so OQS OpenSSL would be defining new identifiers for TLS 1.3 until the draft started defining them. But generally speaking, the IETF draft should be changing the identifiers per iteration (in the end only the final one is added in the IANA registry of course).\r\n\r\n> Practically, (sample) code / downstream integrations would need to be constantly upgraded as some PQ algorithm detail changes if that is encoded in a (configurable) name. I'm not sure everyone would appreciate this. \r\n\r\nI think only the compatibility breaking changes warrant a new identifier. And to be honest, someone would not need to drop the old ones. No one needs to drop support for old identifiers, so that does not break backward compatibility. Only very up-to-date implementations would be negotiating the latest identifiers, older ones could still be functional with older ones. \r\n\r\n> In sum, I'd personally try to refrain from creating PQ \"legacy software\" (defined as code that can keep working in a future it wasn't written for) from the get-go, but rather standardize things more quickly. \r\n\r\nI understand, and to be honest this has not been done well in the past either. Other RFC drafts have not been using a similar logic. \r\n\r\nLet me rephrase my question, and focus on OpenSSH. As we are working through the [draft](https://github.com/csosto-pk/pq-ssh/blob/master/draft-kampanakis-ssh-pq-ke.txt), what if we added an extra identifier? Currently the draft includes SSH method names: \r\n- ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` which OQS OpenSSH supports already\r\n- ```x25519-kyber-512-sha256@amazon.com``` which OQS OpenSSH does not support yet \r\n\r\nWhat if we made them \r\n- ```x25519-kyber-512**r3**-sha256-**d05**@amazon.com```\r\n- ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512**r3**-sha256-**d05**``` This for now would be exactly the same as ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``. It would only would change if the draft ended up changing the combiner or we have Kyber Round 4 etc.\r\n\r\nWould OQS OpenSSH be willing to add support for these two in OQS OpenSSH? \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1418428370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-06T02:53:31Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

As we are working through this, we will all try to interop with the ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```. It is supported in OQS OpenSSH and wolfSSH, which is great. \r\n\r\nNow there is one concern about backwards compatibility. Someone that implements the method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` today may have interop issues in a couple of years when Kyber has been slightly tweaked or something in the method has been tweaked in the draft and the peer implements the latest version. That is a concern for any RFC draft which changes over time. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such problems we could introduce a temporary identifier that basically creates a snapshot of the method in time. For example, we could rename ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` to method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00```. That basically means the method is specific to the time it was implemented (Kyber-512 round 3 the way draft -00 explained the method). In the next change which breaks compatibility for that method, its name will change to something like ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-d01``` or something like that. So, old clients that were not upgraded would not be able to negotiate ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00``` any more and they would still interop using classical methods. When the RFC is ratified, the final standardized name would be ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```\r\n\r\nI know this is not something we have done for TLS 1.3 group names, or SSH methods. But have you given it any thought? Would it be too much overhead to rename the method every time something underlying (KEM algorithm, or implementation detail) changes?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1419798618","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134#issuecomment-1419798618","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134","id":1419798618,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV85UoGha","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-06T21:38:50Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T21:38:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I agree that versioning the names makes sense, and in principle yes we should do that in OQS-OpenSSH.

As we are working through this, we will all try to interop with the ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```. It is supported in OQS OpenSSH and wolfSSH, which is great. \r\n\r\nNow there is one concern about backwards compatibility. Someone that implements the method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` today may have interop issues in a couple of years when Kyber has been slightly tweaked or something in the method has been tweaked in the draft and the peer implements the latest version. That is a concern for any RFC draft which changes over time. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such problems we could introduce a temporary identifier that basically creates a snapshot of the method in time. For example, we could rename ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` to method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00```. That basically means the method is specific to the time it was implemented (Kyber-512 round 3 the way draft -00 explained the method). In the next change which breaks compatibility for that method, its name will change to something like ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-d01``` or something like that. So, old clients that were not upgraded would not be able to negotiate ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00``` any more and they would still interop using classical methods. When the RFC is ratified, the final standardized name would be ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```\r\n\r\nI know this is not something we have done for TLS 1.3 group names, or SSH methods. But have you given it any thought? Would it be too much overhead to rename the method every time something underlying (KEM algorithm, or implementation detail) changes?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1419803590","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134#issuecomment-1419803590","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134","id":1419803590,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV85UoHvG","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-06T21:41:21Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T21:41:21Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Regarding putting the draft identifier in, how do you plan to deal with increments to the draft that don't affect the actual technical details -- if d05 and d06 yield the same protocol, but just text changes, would should be in the implementation: \r\n- Stay with d05, skip d06\r\n- Increment to d06 and and drop d05\r\n- Have both d05 and d06 but treat them as different (even though we know they're equivalent)\r\n- Have both d05 and d06 and treat them as interoperable\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1419803590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-06T21:41:22Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
