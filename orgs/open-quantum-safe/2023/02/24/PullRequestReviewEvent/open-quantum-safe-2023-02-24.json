2022-04-15</h2>\n<p>This release is primarily to replace the <code>attrs</code> package dependency,\nwith the built-in Python <code>dataclasses</code> package.</p>\n<p>This should not be a breaking change, for most use cases.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>⬆️ UPGRADE: Drop support for EOL Python 3.6 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/issues/194\">#194</a>)</li>\n<li>♻️ REFACTOR: Move <code>Rule</code>/<code>Delimiter</code> classes from <code>attrs</code> to <code>dataclass</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/issues/211\">#211</a>)</li>\n<li>♻️ REFACTOR: Move <code>Token</code> class from <code>attrs</code> to <code>dataclass</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/issues/211\">#211</a>)</li>\n<li>‼️ Remove deprecated <code>NestedTokens</code> and <code>nest_tokens</code></li>\n<li>✨ NEW: Save ordered list numbering (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/issues/192\">#192</a>)</li>\n<li>🐛 FIX: Combination of blockquotes, list and newlines causes <code>IndexError</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py/issues/207\">#207</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.1 - 2022-24-01</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>🐛 FIX: Crash when file ends with empty blockquote line.</li>\n<li>✨ NEW: Add <code>inline_definitions</code> option.\nThis option allows for <code>definition</code> token to be inserted into the token stream, at the point where the definition is located in the source text.\nIt is useful for cases where one wishes to capture a &quot;loseless&quot; syntax tree of the parsed Markdown (in conjunction with the <code>store_labels</code> option).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.0.0 - 2021-12-03</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>⬆️ Update: Sync with markdown-it v12.1.0 and CommonMark v0.30</li>\n<li>♻️ REFACTOR: Port <code>mdurl</code> and <code>punycode</code> for URL normalisation (thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/hukkin\"><code>@​hukkin</code></a>!).</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
