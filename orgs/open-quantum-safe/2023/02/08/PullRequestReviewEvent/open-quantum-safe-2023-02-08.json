the requirements on [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) to permit the latest version.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">bindgen's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>0.64.0</h1>\n<h2>Added</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a new set of flags <code>--with-derive-custom</code>,\n<code>--with-derive-custom-struct</code>, <code>--with-derive-custom-enum</code> and\n<code>--with-derive-custom-enum</code> to add custom derives from the CLI.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>--experimental</code> flag on <code>bindgen-cli</code> and the <code>experimental</code>\nfeature on <code>bindgen</code> to gate experimental features whose implementation is\nincomplete or are prone to change in a non-backwards compatible manner.</li>\n<li>Added a new set of flags and their equivalent builder methods\n<code>--wrap-static-fns</code>, <code>--wrap-static-fns-suffix</code> and <code>--wrap-static-fns-path</code>\nto generate C function wrappers for <code>static</code> or <code>static inline</code> functions.\nThis feature is experimental.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed name collisions when having a C <code>enum</code> and a <code>typedef</code> with the same\nname.</li>\n<li>The <code>ParseCallbacks::generated_name_override</code> method now receives <code>ItemInfo&lt;'_&gt;</code> as\nargument instead of a <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated the <code>clang-sys</code> crate version to 1.4.0 to support clang 15.</li>\n<li>The return type is now ommited in signatures of functions returning <code>void</code>.</li>\n<li>Updated the <code>clap</code> dependency for <code>bindgen-cli</code> to 4.</li>\n<li>Rewrote the <code>bindgen-cli</code> argument parser which could introduce unexpected\nbehavior changes.</li>\n<li>The <code>ParseCallbacks::add_derives</code> method now receives <code>DeriveInfo&lt;'_&gt;</code> as\nargument instead of a <code>&amp;str</code>. This type also includes the kind of target type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<h2>Fixed</h2>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<h1>0.63.0</h1>\n<h2>Added</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>new feature: <code>process_comments</code> method to the <code>ParseCallbacks</code> trait to\nhandle source code comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only wrap unsafe operations in unsafe blocks if the <code>--wrap_unsafe_ops</code>\noption is enabled.</li>\n<li>Replace the <code>name: &amp;str</code> argument for <code>ParseCallbacks::add_derives</code> by\n<code>info: DeriveInfo</code>.</li>\n<li>All the rust targets equal or lower than <code>1.30</code> are being deprecated and\nwill be removed in the future. If you have a good reason to use any of these\ntargets, please report it in the issue tracker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Removed</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
