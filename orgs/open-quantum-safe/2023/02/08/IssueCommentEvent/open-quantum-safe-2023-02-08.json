As we are working through this, we will all try to interop with the ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```. It is supported in OQS OpenSSH and wolfSSH, which is great. \r\n\r\nNow there is one concern about backwards compatibility. Someone that implements the method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` today may have interop issues in a couple of years when Kyber has been slightly tweaked or something in the method has been tweaked in the draft and the peer implements the latest version. That is a concern for any RFC draft which changes over time. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such problems we could introduce a temporary identifier that basically creates a snapshot of the method in time. For example, we could rename ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` to method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00```. That basically means the method is specific to the time it was implemented (Kyber-512 round 3 the way draft -00 explained the method). In the next change which breaks compatibility for that method, its name will change to something like ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-d01``` or something like that. So, old clients that were not upgraded would not be able to negotiate ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00``` any more and they would still interop using classical methods. When the RFC is ratified, the final standardized name would be ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```\r\n\r\nI know this is not something we have done for TLS 1.3 group names, or SSH methods. But have you given it any thought? Would it be too much overhead to rename the method every time something underlying (KEM algorithm, or implementation detail) changes?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/comments/1421894182","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134#issuecomment-1421894182","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/134","id":1421894182,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBsoLV85UwGIm","user":{"login":"csosto-pk","id":24617764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjE3NzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24617764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk","html_url":"https://github.com/csosto-pk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csosto-pk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T02:34:56Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T02:34:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Douglas, \r\n\r\n> As the underlying liboqs will only have one version of an algorithm available at a time, \r\n\r\nAgreed. OQS OpenSSH or any other implementation that is not worried about backwards compatibility would just keep updating the latest method name / identifier and it would just forget about the previous one. You would only support the latest version. \r\n\r\nOften drafts put in ```TBD``` in the new identifiers when IANA has not assigned them. Basically we do the same thing and just put something in for implementers to implements.\r\n\r\nNote that I am mostly focusing on OQS OpenSSH right now. OQS OpenSSL did not have any identifiers in the draft, so pretty much OQS historically defined the test identifiers. And updating them in the very early stages with all the algorithms would be hard. So, I am OK with the TLS 1.3 identifiers. I just want to address the OpenSSH problem now that we have a draft to follow.\r\n\r\n> Regarding putting the draft identifier in, how do you plan to deal with increments to the draft that don't affect the actual technical details? For example, if d05 and d06 yield the same protocol, but just the text changes, what should be in the implementation?\r\n\r\nI think in this case we would skip ```06``` and just use the ```0x``` version that makes a compatibility breaking change. Note that we could do it by just putting in ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-tmp1```, ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-tmp2``` etc if we did not want to tie it to the draft version. Other ways could be possible too.
