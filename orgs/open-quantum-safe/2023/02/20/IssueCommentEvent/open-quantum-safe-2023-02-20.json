I'm following up on an issue you posted [here](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/docker-orb/issues/160) with some comments below: \r\n\r\n1. I noticed that you're `arm64` builds don't work for you at the moment. In the issue, you're using version `circleci/docker@2.1.4` of the docker orb. If you update the orb to version `2.2.0`, it'll take care of your issue. \r\n2. I'm in the process of updating the docker orb to support `docker buildx` with multi-architecture builds. It should be available in the next couple of weeks. \r\n3. In the meantime, my colleague has written a sample `config` that will support `docker buildx` on CircleCI. You can find it [here](https://github.com/kelvintaywl-cci/docker-buildx/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml).\r\n\r\nThank you opening an issue with us and bringing this to our attention. I hope this information helps!
