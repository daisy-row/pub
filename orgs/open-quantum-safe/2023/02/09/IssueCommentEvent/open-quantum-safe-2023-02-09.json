As we are working through this, we will all try to interop with the ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```. It is supported in OQS OpenSSH and wolfSSH, which is great. \r\n\r\nNow there is one concern about backwards compatibility. Someone that implements the method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` today may have interop issues in a couple of years when Kyber has been slightly tweaked or something in the method has been tweaked in the draft and the peer implements the latest version. That is a concern for any RFC draft which changes over time. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such problems we could introduce a temporary identifier that basically creates a snapshot of the method in time. For example, we could rename ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256``` to method name ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00```. That basically means the method is specific to the time it was implemented (Kyber-512 round 3 the way draft -00 explained the method). In the next change which breaks compatibility for that method, its name will change to something like ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r4-sha256-d01``` or something like that. So, old clients that were not upgraded would not be able to negotiate ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512r3-sha256-d00``` any more and they would still interop using classical methods. When the RFC is ratified, the final standardized name would be ```ecdh-nistp256-kyber-512-sha256```\r\n\r\nI know this is not something we have done for TLS 1.3 group names, or SSH methods. But have you given it any thought?
