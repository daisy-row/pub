PR changes enable access to the curves and certificate type used in TLSv1.3 handshakes.\r\n\r\nThis equivalent to access to the ciphers used in the TLS session. The benefit is that monitoring/logging can not only report the protocol and ciphers, but also the curve and certificate type used for a TLSv1.3 connection on the client side. In particular, an user can verify that a quantum-safe-crypto curve and certificate was used.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for your pull request.
