It completes within an hour and builds for 3 platforms, if I see things right -- so arguably OK as far as I can see. But does this (ARM64?) run OK on M1?\r\n> \r\n> > as I don't have token/apikey to push image, hence in this PR just build image without push it.\r\n> \r\n> Could you test this out with(in) your own docker hub namespace & API key? For CircleCI we set the variables \"TARGETNAME\" to point to the docker hub (target) repo and \"DOCKER_PASSWORD\" and \"DOCKER_LOGIN\" to log in to docker hub -- an API key with push permission would be an alternative: Could you create something similar to this for this GitHub workflow (and test it out with your own docker hub location / credentials)? Ideally, all we'd need to set is different ENV vars to push things to \"openquantumsafe(/go)\" after you already tested out the logic with(in) your own account. Also, the push should not happen on build but only when finally merging. Please see [this example](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos/blob/67c8fbc749c1fb49d600f90651e57aac693120a2/.circleci/config.yml#L43-L53) how we do it in `oqs-demos`: The code is CCI specific but you surely get the jist: The pattern is always the same: \"build&test\" on PR and \"build, test & push\" when merging to `main` branch.\r\n\r\nok, I will have a try with my own fork. and use github's docker registry service.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/issues/comments/1435921654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-19T08:12:45Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

I guess this would best be added to CI then, right? Would you be willing to make a contribution to facilitate this (maybe first for the [current build](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/blob/1c3e5926116d9f77808f55776c418d46190b1e70/.circleci/config.yml#L81-L103))?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/issues/comments/1436046501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-02-19T17:30:42Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
