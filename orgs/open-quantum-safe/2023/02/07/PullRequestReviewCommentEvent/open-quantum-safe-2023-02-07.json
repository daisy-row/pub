Also, any lessons learned (what went wrong, what should be looked into to get MSVC to work) would be a great addition to the comments section in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/47.\r\nAlso regarding testing: If this doesn't work, can you state why? Is it something that can be fixed easily (.bat file instead of .sh, for example) or that is so complex that the platform should be excluded from testing completely, e.g., in
