We build liboqs with `-DOQS_ALGS_ENABLED=STD` to minimize support of non-standardized algorithms.\r\n\r\nWe found that the folders\r\n```\r\n./src/kem/kyber/pqclean_kyber*_aarch64\r\n./src/sig/dilithium/pqclean_dilithium*_aarch64\r\n./src/sig/sphincs/pqclean_sphincs*\r\n```\r\ncontain CC0 license which is not acceptable for Fedora by default (and AFAIU, other Linux distributions).\r\n\r\nI believe that for aarch64 we could fallback to a generic (slower) implementation in the compile time, but it's obviously not the best possible option.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to get in contact with the authors of these implementation to get an agreement about double-licensing of these implementations? MIT, Apache2 or smth else is fine for our purpose.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-17T08:13:06Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
