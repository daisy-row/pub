Using `sed` in turn ensures we're always in sync with upstream master in this regard. And if an error running the expression occurs, we know precisely where to look and can understand what's new.\r\n\r\nA fixed config file IMO would be preferable only if we also tie down the openssl code used, i.e., not use master. And _that_ would not be sensible given we need pretty current `openssl` code to run this.","created_at":"2023-04-11T14:23:59Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T14:24:00Z","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pull/92#discussion_r1162898743","pull_request_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/92","author_association":"MEMBER","_links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/comments/1162898743"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pull/92#discussion_r1162898743"},"pull_request":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/92"}},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/comments/1162898743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"start_line":null,"original_start_line":null,"start_side":null,"line":65,"original_line":65,"side":"RIGHT","in_reply_to_id":1162875986,"original_position":72,"position":72,"subject_type":"line"},"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pulls/92","id":1308419542,"node_id":"PR_kwDOETYnOM5N_OXW","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pull/92","diff_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pull/92.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/pull/92.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/profiling/issues/92","number":92,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Upgrade to OpenSSL3","user":{"login":"baentsch","id":57787676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch","html_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baentsch/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"body":"As per https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/discussions/434#discussioncomment-5421852 switching another downstream project.
