For a \"casual\" user, there won't be much difference between ignoring printout of 4 env vars vs. ignoring, say, 8 env vars. And I don't think your scripts use even as much as 8. But, again, **all** of those used need to be shown - to see what value they actually took for the run.\r\n\r\n> Would it be an option to \"auto-magically\" activate that if any of the \"OQSPROV|SIG|KEM\" debug env vars were set when running the script(s)?\r\n\r\nNot sure.
