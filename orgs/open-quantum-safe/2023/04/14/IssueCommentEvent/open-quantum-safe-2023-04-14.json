I think that the vast majority of schemes only call `randombytes()` once, and it would in principle be easy to patch all of the schemes to take a seed instead of them calling randombytes, and providing the original API as a wrapper:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nvoid crypto_sign_keypair_seeded(uint8_t *pk, uint8_t *sk, uint8_t[SEED_LEN] seed);\r\nvoid crypto_sign_keypair(uint8_t *pk, uint8_t *sk) {\r\n  uint8_t seed[SEED_LEN];\r\n  randombytes(&seed, SEED_LEN);\r\n  crypto_sign_keypair_seeded(pk, sk, &seed);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems that a function pointer hack is just a more complicated way of achieving the same end result — in both cases, the implementation of every single scheme needs to be patched. The only case in which the function pointer mechanism might be better is if a scheme calls `randombytes` multiple times, which could be a problem with how the KAT work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1508346079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-14T11:10:12Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}

We'll have to work through doing it in all the Kyber implementations (we pull from both PQClean and PQCrystals), but it shouldn't be too hard to patch in.\r\n> > There's the question of whether we also do it for the other KEMs in liboqs, but I think it's less pressing for them, so I'm okay with doing it first in Kyber and leaving the rest to another time.\r\n> \r\n> Great!\r\n\r\nAgreed. Derandomized key gen is also a little dangerous; I've seen some libraries include words like \"hazardous\" in the function API to flag that, do you think we should do so?\r\n\r\nDo you have any cycles for any of this?  I am traveling next week and certainly won't have a chance to work on it then.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1509281831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-04-14T21:17:33Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
