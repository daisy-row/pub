Original XMSS has signature format: `(sm || m)` (signature concatenates with message). This PR separates `sm` and `m`. Minimal change to internal of XMSS. See: \r\na. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-c79859c458945f7449e50f5ca7e44857716c35763142802cba881cdfd0a61df7\r\nb. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-2089b4bfa66835b4b7b1d2b4c54c9622288b9149badc7dfd92167fc194f8961a\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Original XMSS has hash calls like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n                     unsigned char *out,\r\n                     const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    unsigned char buf[32];\r\n\r\n    if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(buf, in, inlen);\r\n        memcpy(out, buf, 24);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 24, in, inlen);\r\n    }   \r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE128) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake128(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha512(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 64, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR optimizes hash call via define macro at compile time. The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6. A way to generate NIST-KAT: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/16/files#diff-b8143f018bcb227109839d76aa73c408742fa1fd56b6c4013833274583321c4d\r\n\r\nAll the changes above are propagated to this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

Original XMSS has signature format: `(sm || m)` (signature concatenates with message). This PR separates `sm` and `m`. Minimal change to internal of XMSS. See: \r\na. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-c79859c458945f7449e50f5ca7e44857716c35763142802cba881cdfd0a61df7\r\nb. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-2089b4bfa66835b4b7b1d2b4c54c9622288b9149badc7dfd92167fc194f8961a\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Original XMSS has hash calls like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n                     unsigned char *out,\r\n                     const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    unsigned char buf[32];\r\n\r\n    if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(buf, in, inlen);\r\n        memcpy(out, buf, 24);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 24, in, inlen);\r\n    }   \r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE128) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake128(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha512(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 64, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR optimizes hash call via define macro at compile time. The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6. A way to generate NIST-KAT: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/16/files#diff-b8143f018bcb227109839d76aa73c408742fa1fd56b6c4013833274583321c4d\r\n\r\nAll the changes above are propagated to this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6.

Original XMSS has signature format: `(sm || m)` (signature concatenates with message). This PR separates `sm` and `m`. Minimal change to internal of XMSS. See: \r\na. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-c79859c458945f7449e50f5ca7e44857716c35763142802cba881cdfd0a61df7\r\nb. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-2089b4bfa66835b4b7b1d2b4c54c9622288b9149badc7dfd92167fc194f8961a\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Original XMSS has hash calls like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n                     unsigned char *out,\r\n                     const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    unsigned char buf[32];\r\n\r\n    if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(buf, in, inlen);\r\n        memcpy(out, buf, 24);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 24, in, inlen);\r\n    }   \r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE128) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake128(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha512(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 64, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR optimizes hash call via define macro at compile time. The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6. A way to generate NIST-KAT: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/16/files#diff-b8143f018bcb227109839d76aa73c408742fa1fd56b6c4013833274583321c4d\r\n\r\nAll the changes above are propagated to this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6.

Original XMSS has signature format: `(sm || m)` (signature concatenates with message). This PR separates `sm` and `m`. Minimal change to internal of XMSS. See: \r\na. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-c79859c458945f7449e50f5ca7e44857716c35763142802cba881cdfd0a61df7\r\nb. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-2089b4bfa66835b4b7b1d2b4c54c9622288b9149badc7dfd92167fc194f8961a\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Original XMSS has hash calls like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n                     unsigned char *out,\r\n                     const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    unsigned char buf[32];\r\n\r\n    if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(buf, in, inlen);\r\n        memcpy(out, buf, 24);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 24, in, inlen);\r\n    }   \r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE128) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake128(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha512(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 64, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR optimizes hash call via define macro at compile time. The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6. A way to generate NIST-KAT: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/16/files#diff-b8143f018bcb227109839d76aa73c408742fa1fd56b6c4013833274583321c4d\r\n\r\nAll the changes above are propagated to this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5.

Original XMSS has signature format: `(sm || m)` (signature concatenates with message). This PR separates `sm` and `m`. Minimal change to internal of XMSS. See: \r\na. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-c79859c458945f7449e50f5ca7e44857716c35763142802cba881cdfd0a61df7\r\nb. https://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/commit/954308800a0ba47357c881838e8ce585a9cd3d97#diff-2089b4bfa66835b4b7b1d2b4c54c9622288b9149badc7dfd92167fc194f8961a\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Original XMSS has hash calls like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic int core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n                     unsigned char *out,\r\n                     const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    unsigned char buf[32];\r\n\r\n    if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(buf, in, inlen);\r\n        memcpy(out, buf, 24);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 24 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 24, in, inlen);\r\n    }   \r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE128) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake128(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 32 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 32, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHA2) {\r\n        OQS_SHA2_sha512(out, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (params->n == 64 && params->func == XMSS_SHAKE256) {\r\n        OQS_SHA3_shake256(out, 64, in, inlen);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR optimizes hash call via define macro at compile time. The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5. Additional robust check for unsigned int and memory initialization error: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/17/files\r\n\r\n6. A way to generate NIST-KAT: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ducnguyen-sb/xmss-reference/pull/16/files#diff-b8143f018bcb227109839d76aa73c408742fa1fd56b6c4013833274583321c4d\r\n\r\nAll the changes above are propagated to this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

The goal is to write just enough code to serve the hash call, and avoid branch jump during execution. Example for parameter `xmss_sha256_h10`:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <oqs/sha2.h>\r\n#include \"hash.h\"\r\n\r\nint core_hash(const xmss_params *params,\r\n              unsigned char *out,\r\n              const unsigned char *in, unsigned long long inlen)\r\n{\r\n    (void)params;\r\n    OQS_SHA2_sha256(out, in, inlen);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Share code: This PR has plan to share code between parameters using define and namespace. The differences between parameters at compile time is handled by carefully craft `CMakefile.txt`\r\n\r\n5.
