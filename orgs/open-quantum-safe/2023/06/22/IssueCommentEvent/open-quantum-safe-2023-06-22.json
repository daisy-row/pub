If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\"\r\n\r\nNot that I'm aware of.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nThe initial motivation for this PR was a [small documentation change](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/188/commits/261bc2fb06b02c9732f22c3f695a42e700855332). That change uncovered an unexpected warning message. It appears that the erroneous warning message motivating this commit is due to some vestigial code special-casing x-curves. The `nid_ecx_hyybrid` kem field was only used to generate the duplicate ecx nid warning message, so we track duplicates in a local `set` instead. Additionally, we expand the warning message to all curve NIDs, not just x-curves and treat duplicates as fatal because extra curve NIDs should be unique for each KEM.\r\n\r\nDuplicate NID detection is tested below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git diff\r\ndiff --git a/oqs-template/generate.yml b/oqs-template/generate.yml\r\nindex 4865eb7..fa3ddfe 100644\r\n--- a/oqs-template/generate.yml\r\n+++ b/oqs-template/generate.yml\r\n@@ -114,6 +114,8 @@ kems:\r\n           nid: '0x2F90'\r\n         - hybrid_group: \"x25519\"\r\n           nid: '0x6399'\r\n+        - hybrid_group: \"p521\"\r\n+          nid: '0x6399'\r\n         - hybrid_group: \"p256\"\r\n           nid: '0x639A'\r\n       old:\r\n\r\n$ LIBOQS_SRC_DIR=$(pwd)/../liboqs python3 oqs-template/generate.py\r\nERROR: duplicate hybrid NID for kyber768 : 0x6399 in generate.yml.
