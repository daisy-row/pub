By doing so, we let the user choose the build type of library.\r\n\r\nBy default, CMake will build a static library. Thus, [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`] must be used to switch to a shared library.\r\n\r\n`oqs-provider` as a static library allows us to use the provider without having to store its shared library somewhere. In addition, it happens that some operating systems prohibit the use of `dlopen`/`dlsym`.\r\n\r\nTo load `oqs-provider` when it is embedded into a library of a binary, one can use the [`OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin`] API from OpenSSL 3.\r\n\r\n[`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html\r\n[`OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man3/OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin.html\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?

By doing so, we let the user choose the build type of library.\r\n\r\nBy default, CMake will build a static library. Thus, [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`] must be used to switch to a shared library.\r\n\r\n`oqs-provider` as a static library allows us to use the provider without having to store its shared library somewhere. In addition, it happens that some operating systems prohibit the use of `dlopen`/`dlsym`.\r\n\r\nTo load `oqs-provider` when it is embedded into a library of a binary, one can use the [`OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin`] API from OpenSSL 3.\r\n\r\n[`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html\r\n[`OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin`]: https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.1/man3/OSSL_PROVIDER_add_builtin.html\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
