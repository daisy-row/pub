More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.\r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.\r\n\r\n**open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) OpenSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography in TLS 1.3, X.509 certificates, CMS, and S/MIME.  The integration should not be considered \"production quality\".\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is release candidate 1 of the 2023-06 snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL, which was released on June 20, 2023.  This release is intended to be used with liboqs version 0.8.0.\r\n\r\nEND OF LIFE NOTICE\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nAs the OpenSSL team has announced that OpenSSL 1.1.1 will reach [end of life in September 2023](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/03/28/1.1.1-EOL/), this release is intended to be the final release of OQS-OpenSSL_1\\_1\\_1-stable.  Users are recommended to migrate to OpenSSL 3 and make use of the [OQS Provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/) which provides full post-quantum support in OpenSSL 3.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is the tenth snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL_1\\_1\\_1-stable.  It is based on OpenSSL 1.1.1u.\r\n\r\n- Update OpenSSL to version 1.1.1u.\r\n- Key encapsulation mechanism algorithm changes:\r\n  - BIKE: updated to Round 4 version.\r\n  - Kyber: 90s variants were removed.\r\n  - NTRU Prime: All variants were removed.\r\n  - Saber: removed.\r\n- Digital signature scheme algorithm changes:\r\n  - Dilithium; AES variants were removed.\r\n  - Falcon: updated to the 2023-02-07 version.\r\n  - Picnic: removed.\r\n  - Rainbow: removed.\r\n  - SPHINCS+: updated to version 3.1; SPHINCS+-Haraka variants were removed; SPHINCS+-SHA256 and SPHINCS+-SHAKE variants were renamed\r\n- Update OIDs and TLS key exchange code points\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* documentation generator fix by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/394\r\n* Upstream 1.1.1s by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/407\r\n* removing Picnic,NTRUprime,Rainbow,Saber by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/411\r\n* adds IDs for proper wireshark sigalg dissection by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/412\r\n* Updated upstream tag reference to 1.1.1s. by @christianpaquin in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/414\r\n* Removed NTRU. by @xvzcf in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/415\r\n* remove boringssl interop by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/417\r\n* change sphincs variant enablement by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/425\r\n* Upgrade to upstream 1.1.1t by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/430\r\n* (O)ID update for BIKE and Falcon using oqs-provider template by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/438\r\n* version and build instruction update by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/443\r\n* Algorithm & ID updates by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/447\r\n* Merged 1.1.1u by @christianpaquin in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/453\r\n* Code point documentation update by @baentsch in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/458\r\n* Updated generate.yml to support liboqs 0.8.0 algorithm changes by @crt26 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/456\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @crt26 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/pull/456\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/compare/OQS-OpenSSL-1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2022-08...OQS-OpenSSL-1_1_1-stable-snapshot-2023-06-rc-1","mentions_count":4,"mentions":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16247285?v=4","login":"christianpaquin","profile_name":"Christian Paquin","profile_url":"https://github.com/christianpaquin","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21228961?v=4","login":"xvzcf","profile_name":"Goutam Tamvada","profile_url":"https://github.com/xvzcf","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57787676?v=4","login":"baentsch","profile_name":"Michael Baentsch","profile_url":"https://github.com/baentsch","avatar_user_actor":true},{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63823484?v=4","login":"crt26","profile_name":"Callum","profile_url":"https://github.com/crt26","avatar_user_actor":true}],"short_description_html":"<h1>OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable snapshot 2023-06-rc1</h1>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project</strong> has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.
