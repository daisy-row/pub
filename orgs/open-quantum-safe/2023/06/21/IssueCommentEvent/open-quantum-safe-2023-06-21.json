No oqsprovider code at all should be executed if openssl is configured with -no_tls1_3 (see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#status). This very clearly is an openssl issue.\r\n\r\nOk then I'll raise that issue with openssl. We agree that the relevant implementation in this context is the implementation in oqsprov_capabilities.c? Namely the use of ```OSSL_CAPABILITY_TLS_GROUP_MIN_TLS```? \r\n\r\n> This command is incomplete (what are you connecting to?).\r\n\r\nThe client was meant to connect to the s_server instance posted at the top. What I wanted to highlight was that they are able to communicate even though the -groups config should be unsupported + that their groups do not match.\r\n```\r\n#Server:\r\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.local/lib64 .local/bin/openssl s_server -cert rsa_srv.crt -key rsa_srv.key -www -no_tls1_3 -groups kyber768 -provider-path oqs-provider/_build/lib  -provider default -provider oqsprovider\r\n#Client:\r\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.local/lib64 .local/bin/openssl s_client -curves frodo640shake -provider-path oqs-provider/_build/lib -provider default -provider oqsprovider -CAfile rsa_CA.crt -no_tls1_3\r\n```\r\n\r\n> When I test this with the interop server, it fails as expected:\r\n\r\nLooks like it fails on the protocol version negotiation, which should be expected even without the oqs-provider?\r\n\r\nThanks for the swift replies.
