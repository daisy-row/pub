I'm only interested in the log produced by the _current_ run, not the one left behind from whatever succeeded or failed before it.\r\n\r\n> The unsuccessful detection of sig algs in the latest run is caused by a missing \"-provider oqsprovider\" statement in the `for` loop, explaining the difference between \"list\" and execution.\r\n\r\nBut that was your script - I did not touch that part: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/07107deb2a9dc7d94ee7e52e7b34e1eb32a42a89/scripts/runtests.sh#L150\r\n\r\n> Most importantly, you have set the wrong `openssl.cnf` file for the certgen test: `test/oqs.cnf` is only meant as an example for provider-activation.\r\n\r\nI see. I did not realize this - and started experimenting with `OPENSSL_CONF` after I noticed that the tests used the system-wide `openssl.cnf` with providers installed there, instead of the just-buit and being-tested `oqsprovider`. Hence the `oqs` (installed system-wide) vs. `oqsprovider` (what your package builds and tests).\r\n\r\n> Only when using `scripts/openssl-ca.cnf` certificates can be correctly created, so please either fix that in your wrapper (or remove the explicit setting of the env var `OPENSSL_CONF` as `runtests.sh` will set it correctly if not externally set).\r\n\r\nOne reason I was explicitly setting `OPENSSL_CONF` was that my `~/.zprofile` sets it so  that the \"normal\" commands and apps use the correct OpenSSL config. For OpenSSL-3.2.0-dev, naturally, I have to point it to a different config file...\r\n\r\nI think when my über-script did `unset OPENSSL_CONF`, there were problems. But now, with `unset OPENSSL_CONF` all tests pass for OpenSSL-3.2.0-dev.\r\n\r\nBTW, what about `OPENSSL_MODULES` env var? I've set it to `${PWD}/_build/lib`.\r\n\r\n> So I presume that file contains further changes I don't know about . . .\r\n\r\nNope, it does not. That was a complete file.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1581621831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-06-07T23:02:58Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
