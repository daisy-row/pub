It adds a new compile flag, \"OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR\", which exposes deterministic key derivation. This is intended to be used with RFC 9180 for hybrid public key encryption, which defines KEMs to have a \"DeriveKeyPair\" algorithm (in addition to key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\nAdds functionality requested in #1206 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider), [OQS-OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl), [OQS-BoringSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl), and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\nThis adds a \"derive_keypair\" to the KEM API when the compile flag OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR is enabled.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nI tried to have it so that if the OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR is not defined, then no changes happen to liboqs. This results in some code replication. A smarter way to do it would be to have regular key generation just call deterministic key generation with a random seed, but this would mean altering how regular key generation works so I stayed away from that (for now). It should be an easy change everywhere else if that's eventually modified.\r\n\r\nAs well, I've added a test_derive_keypair script, which just derives a keypair twice from the same, random seed and compares them to check that the same secret and public key is derived each time.\r\n\r\nThere should be some sort of check to make sure that everything other than kyber is disabled, since this only adds deterministic key derivation for kyber, but I wasn't sure about the best way to add that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1582499077","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1491#issuecomment-1582499077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491","id":1582499077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5eUwUF","user":{"login":"bhess","id":149199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTE5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/149199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess","html_url":"https://github.com/bhess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhess/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-08T12:31:57Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T12:31:57Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"The changes to `src/kem/kyber/...` would probably be overwritten after pulling updates with copy_from_upstream.

It adds a new compile flag, \"OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR\", which exposes deterministic key derivation. This is intended to be used with RFC 9180 for hybrid public key encryption, which defines KEMs to have a \"DeriveKeyPair\" algorithm (in addition to key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation).\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?  If so, please reference it using automatic-closing keywords like \"Fixes #123.\" -->\r\n\r\nAdds functionality requested in #1206 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please answer the following questions to help manage version and changes across projects. -->\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does this PR change the input/output behaviour of a cryptographic algorithm (i.e., does it change known answer test values)?  (If so, a version bump will be required from *x.y.z* to *x.(y+1).0*.)\r\n* [x] Does this PR change the list of algorithms available -- either adding, removing, or renaming? Does this PR otherwise change an API? (If so, PRs in [oqs-provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider), [OQS-OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl), [OQS-BoringSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl), and [OQS-OpenSSH](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh) will also need to be ready for review and merge by the time this is merged.)\r\n\r\nThis adds a \"derive_keypair\" to the KEM API when the compile flag OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR is enabled.\r\n\r\n<!-- Once your pull request is ready for review and passing continuous integration tests, please convert from a draft PR to a normal PR, and request a review from one of the OQS core team members. -->\r\n\r\nI tried to have it so that if the OQS_HAZARDOUS_ENABLE_DERIVE_KEYPAIR is not defined, then no changes happen to liboqs. This results in some code replication. A smarter way to do it would be to have regular key generation just call deterministic key generation with a random seed, but this would mean altering how regular key generation works so I stayed away from that (for now). It should be an easy change everywhere else if that's eventually modified.\r\n\r\nAs well, I've added a test_derive_keypair script, which just derives a keypair twice from the same, random seed and compares them to check that the same secret and public key is derived each time.\r\n\r\nThere should be some sort of check to make sure that everything other than kyber is disabled, since this only adds deterministic key derivation for kyber, but I wasn't sure about the best way to add that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1582603940","html_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1491#issuecomment-1582603940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/1491","id":1582603940,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA-eq3c5eVJ6k","user":{"login":"dstebila","id":8843219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDMyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8843219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila","html_url":"https://github.com/dstebila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstebila/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-08T13:43:16Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T13:43:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> The changes to `src/kem/kyber/...` would probably be overwritten after pulling updates with copy_from_upstream.
