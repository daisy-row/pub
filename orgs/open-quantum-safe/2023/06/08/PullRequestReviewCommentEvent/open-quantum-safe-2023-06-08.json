One thing that's unclear though is how the caller is told what the length of the allocated byte array is.\r\n\r\nI think `get_key` is a bit unclear as a method name. Maybe either `key_to_byte_string` or `serialize_key`.\r\n\r\nAlso will need to add something that deserializes the key from a byte string back to an OQS_SECRET_KEY object.
