More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1; see the [OQS-OpenSSL-1\\_1\\_1-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable) branch of our OpenSSL fork's repository.\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.  Performance of liboqs in several settings is measured at https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking/.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- .NET, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-dotnet\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.8.0 of liboqs.  It was released on June 7, 2023.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.7.2 release of liboqs. \r\n\r\nThis release features many algorithm updates, including removal of algorithms and variants no longer proceeding through NIST standardization and updates to newer versions.  See the detailed list of algorithm updates below.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- BIKE: updated to Round 4 version.\r\n- Kyber: 90s variants were removed.\r\n- NTRU Prime: All variants were removed, except for sntrup761.\r\n- Saber: removed.\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- Dilithium; AES variants were removed.\r\n- Falcon: updated to the 2023-02-07 version.\r\n- Picnic: removed.\r\n- Rainbow: removed.\r\n- SPHINCS+: updated to version 3.1; SPHINCS+-Haraka variants were removed; SPHINCS+-SHA256 and SPHINCS+-SHAKE variants were renamed\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Add Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM)\r\n- Improve building on ARM platforms\r\n- Improve performance when using OpenSSL 3 for symmetric cryptography\r\n- Increment shared object library version\r\n- New configure-time options for algorithm selections\r\n- pkgconfig file now available\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Add missing
