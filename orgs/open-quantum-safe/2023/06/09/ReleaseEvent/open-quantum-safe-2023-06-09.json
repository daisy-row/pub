This release is guaranteed to be in sync with v0.8.0 of `liboqs`.\r\n\r\noqs-provider now also enables use of QSC algorithms during TLS1.3 handshake. The required OpenSSL code updates are contained in https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/19312.\r\n\r\n### Algorithm updates\r\n\r\nAll algorithms no longer supported in the [NIST PQC competition](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography) and not under consideration for standardization by ISO have been removed. All remaining algorithms with the exception of McEliece have been lifted to their final round 3 variants as documented in [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/RELEASE.md#release-notes). Most notably, algorithm names for Sphincs+ have been changed to the naming chosen by its authors.\r\n\r\n### Functional updates\r\n\r\n- Enablement of oqs-provider as a (first) dynamically fetchable OpenSSL3 TLS1.3 signature provider.\r\n- OSX support\r\n- Full support for CA functionality\r\n- Algorithms can now be selected by their respective bit strength using the property string \"oqsprovider.security_bits\"\r\n- Documentation of (O)IDs used by the different PQC algorithms used and supported in current and past releases of oqs-openssl and oqs-provider\r\n- Testing is now completely independent of a source code distribution of OpenSSL being available\r\n- oqsprovider can be built and installed making use of pre-existing installations of `OpenSSL` and `liboqs`. Details are found in the \"scripts\" directory's build and test scripts.\r\n- Automated creation of (Debian) packaging information\r\n- Graceful handling (by way of functional degradation) of the feature sets contained in different OpenSSL releases; all oqsprovider capabilities are only available when using a version > than OpenSSL3.1.\r\n- A bug regarding handling of hybrid algorithms has been fixed as well as some memory leaks.\r\n\r\n### Misc updates\r\n\r\n- Dynamic code point and OID changes via environment variables. See [ALGORITHMS.md](ALGORITHMS.md).\r\n- Dynamic key encoding changes via environment variable using external qsc_key_encoder library. See [ALGORITHMS.md](ALGORITHMS.md).","discussion_url":"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/discussions/180","short_description_html":"<p>This release continues from the 0.4.0 release of oqs-provider and is fully tested to be used in conjunction with the main branch of <a href=\"https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs\">liboqs</a>.
