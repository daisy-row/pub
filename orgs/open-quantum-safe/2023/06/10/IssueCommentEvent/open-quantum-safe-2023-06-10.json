Besides, the support always was very limited (only a few algorithm combinations -- hence the text you left in). Therefore, I would go even further and would remove as part of this PR Chromium from the list of supported demos -- I did the same with `haproxy` as there was no feedback to the opposite (no-one speaking up voicing interest to use it). Code remained, but no CI any more. That way, it can be resuscitated if someone would pledge the time to maintain it. \r\n\r\n@dstebila @christianpaquin What's your take?
