Here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\n> Given the latest comment above, it appears to be moot to include the HQC code from 2021 as stated at the beginning of the issue but rather directly jump to the round4/2022 code, right?\r\n\r\nYes, we should jump straight to the latest (and, hopefully, most secure) iteration.\r\n\r\n> Looking at those variants, I'd further wonder which of the different alternatives should be integrated (\"Reference\", \"Optimized\", \"Additional\", \"Hardware\")? From a safety perspective, only the \"Additional\" code appears to be a sensible addition, as it seems to address #995.\r\n\r\n- The \"Hardware\" version is meant to be transformed into VHDL code (see section 3.3 of the supporting documentation), so I assume (?) that it's out of scope for liboqs.\r\n- It seems that the \"Additional\" code (mostly) addresses [#995](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/995) but not [PQClean/PQClean#482](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482) (contrary to my understanding after reading the submission documentation). \r\n- The \"Reference\" and \"Optimized\" variants do implement a countemeasure meant to address [PQClean/PQClean#482](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482). I'm assuming that this is why there are (identical) KAT files for these two variants and none for the \"Additional\" variant; the `vect_set_random_fixed_weight` function retains the older implementation in \"Additional\", which (presumably) results in different KAT responses.\r\n\r\n> Next, as `liboqs` imports this from PQClean and reading [PQClean/PQClean#482 (comment)](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482#issuecomment-1469895912) it doesn't seem likely this is a topic of active work in PQClean/will be resolved soon, right?\r\n\r\nThat seems like a fair assessment to me.\r\n\r\n> Looking at what's the biggest obstacle to an 0.9.0 release it seems to be this issue. Would you agree, @SWilson4 ? Any suggestions how to tackle this?\r\n\r\nMy suggestions would be to\r\n1. Create a \"clean\" implementation, based on the latest \"Reference\" and \"Additional\" variants, and incorporating @jschanck's modifications for the previous PQClean version as needed. A bit of new code will be required to clean up the `vect_set_random_fixed_weight` function.\r\n2. Get this implementation incorporated into PQClean.\r\n3. Update liboqs to use the new PQClean implementation.\r\n\r\nThoughts on this approach, @dstebila,  @thomwiggers, and @baentsch?\r\n\r\nif we take this route, I'd be happy to take on the task of putting together the \"clean\" implementation. It seems fairly straightforward to me; I don't think major revisions will be required.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think this issue is on a different trajectory from the other updates slated for 0.9.0, so I'm inclined to roll the HQC updates into a future release.\r\n\r\nFollow-up question: will we want to update the AVX2 version at the same time as the \"clean\" version? If so, I could take that on as well, with the caveat that there will be a bit of a learning curve.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1665872221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-04T16:19:41Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
