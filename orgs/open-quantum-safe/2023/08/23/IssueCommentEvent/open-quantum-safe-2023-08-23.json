In our experiments we use a dummy value of `1,2,3,4,1945,1111,9999` for Kyber512, with the intention to replace it as soon as the world moves on.\r\n\r\nThe logic can be triggered via openssl's `cmp` command. Here's a recipe you can follow to invoke the KEM-related logic from the aforementioned openssl branch. The test environment requires a CMP server and a CMP client, both can be simulated with OpenSSL. A scenario can look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$cd openssl/test/recipes/80-test_cmp_http_data/Mock\r\n# Run the server with a KEM key in one terminal \r\n$openssl cmp -config server_withkem.cnf -verbosity 8 -port 1700\r\n\r\n# in another terminal, run the client\r\n$openssl cmp -server 127.0.0.1:1700 -config test_withserverkem.cnf -section \"Mock commands\" -no_proxy 127.0.0.1 -cmd ir -cert signer.crt -key signer.key -srvcert kem.crt -certout out.test.pem \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe configuration files, certificates and keys used by the mock are a [part of the repository](https://github.com/siemens/openssl/tree/add_KEM_support/test/recipes/80-test_cmp_http_data/Mock), so the example should work out of the box.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo tinker with a post-quantum KEM, you'll need a KEM certificate. At the moment I have no elegant of producing one (normally I'd do it with OpenSSL :-). I'm attaching a sample I concocted manually, by taking a classic cert, replacing the subject public key with the raw bytes of Kyber512 as returned by liboqs/python and wrapped in a BitString, changing the algorithm OID; then signing it it with an RSA key and updating the signature. \r\n\r\n[kem-cert-experiment.zip](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/files/12421242/kem-cert-experiment.zip)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1690269023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-23T16:27:15Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
