Example: \r\nhttps://test.openquantumsafe.org:6043 returned `Successfully connected using !`. With the update it returns `Successfully connected using rsa3072-x25519!`\r\n\r\n-> updated interop.conf to not hardcode the negotiated group in the response html but instead use nginx's `$ssl_curve` variable available from v1.21.5. Also needed to patch nginx to correctly resolve the string when using OpenSSL >= 3.0.\r\n\r\n- server html response was malformed (missing `</html>` tag)\r\n\r\nThe update is already applied to

This PR updates the Valgrind suppression files for the constant time tests. \r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the failures that Valgrind reports depend on the environment I'm running the constant time tests in. Valgrind reports additional errors when running on my machine's native build environment as opposed to the `ci-ubuntu-focal-x86_64` docker image; this PR documents those additional errors.\r\n\r\nAll errors are documented as \"issues\" at the moment. A later review by a McEcliece expert to sort these errors into \"issues\" and \"passes\" would be beneficial .\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1515. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a brief explanation of the purpose of this pull request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this PR resolve any issue?
