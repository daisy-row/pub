From reading [this](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/305dc68add0e6b8e52cb5208d5803ac94f90bfb6/crypto/provider.c#L31) I would've expected that every provider explicitly loaded (via API) also gets activated. But then again, code like [this](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/305dc68add0e6b8e52cb5208d5803ac94f90bfb6/crypto/provider.c#L38) makes me wonder whether it's getting _deactivated_....","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues/comments/1700777482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-31T10:26:49Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
