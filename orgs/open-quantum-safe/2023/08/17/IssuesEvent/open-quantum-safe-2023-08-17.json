The reason is the Kyber-512's security level is considered less than 128-bits and those that want to be conservative chose Kyber768 as the default. Drafts [draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-tls-westerbaan-xyber768d00) and [draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-kyber](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-kyber) got assigned temporary codepoints for ECDH with Kyber768 combinations. These are supported in OQS OpenSSL already I believe.\r\n\r\nI think this can be the sane strategy for a temporary IANA codepoint for SSH on top of the temporary, \"arbitrary\" ones in [draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kampanakis-curdle-ssh-pq-ke) we are all have coded to. \r\n\r\nSo, after we have the first draft spec of Kyber768, we would like to add support for P256-Kyber768 by using a \"permanent temporary\" IANA registry codepoint. This codepoint can live forever until we get the final final spec. At that point we will not need the codepoint any more, but it can still be supported until everyone migrates. This is the approach TLS is taking as well. \r\n\r\nWe would like to have OQS OpenSSH support this codepoint as the defacto PQ OpenSSH library. Otherwise there is no reason to support it on our own. \r\n\r\nAny interest in adding support for a \"temporary permanent\" P256+Kyber768 codepoint?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/openssh/issues/145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-17T15:55:14Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
