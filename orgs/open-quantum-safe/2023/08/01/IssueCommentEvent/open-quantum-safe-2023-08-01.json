Would you agree, @SWilson4 ? Any suggestions how to tackle this? \r\n\r\nGiven the latest comment above, it appears to be moot to include the HQC code from 2021 as stated at the beginning of the issue but rather directly jump to the round4/2022 code, right? \r\n\r\nLooking at those variants, I'd further wonder which of the different alternatives should be integrated (\"Reference\", \"Optimized\", \"Additional\", \"Hardware\")? From a safety perspective, only the \"Additional\" code appears to be a sensible addition, as it seems to address #995.\r\n\r\nNext, as `liboqs` imports this from PQClean and reading https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482#issuecomment-1469895912 it doesn't seem likely this is a topic of active work in PQClean/will be resolved soon, right?\r\n\r\nSo the underlying question is: Does _anyone_ care about (using/test-driving) HQC? If not, what about the idea to only include the latest \"Additional\" code (for completeness of `liboqs` and resolution of #995), possibly \"bypassing\" PQClean (or working there to resolve https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/issues/482)? Or to drop this issue from the 0.9.0 release (if really _no-one_ has an interest in (using the latest code of) HQC)? \r\n\r\n@christianpaquin : Does the NCCoE project have any interest in (the latest code of) this algorithm? Is the constant-time property more valuable than an optimized variant?\r\n@dstebila : Are you in contact with any authors of HQC to ask whether they would see value in seeing the latest code integrated here/used/tested in TLS etc (and have a recommendation as to which variant to integrate)?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/issues/comments/1659605162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2023-08-01T05:45:36Z","org":{"id":20689385,"login":"open-quantum-safe","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/open-quantum-safe","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20689385?"}}
